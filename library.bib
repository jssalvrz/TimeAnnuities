abstract = {Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a technique for identifying the best practices of a given set of decision-making units (DMUs) whose performance is categorized by multiple performance metrics that are classified as inputs and outputs. Although DEA is regarded as non-parametric, the sample size can be an issue of great importance in determining the efficiency scores for the evaluated units, empirically, when the use of too many inputs and outputs may result in a significant number of DMUs being rated as efficient. In the DEA literature, empirical rules have been established to avoid too many DMUs being rated as efficient. These empirical thresholds relate the number of variables with the number of observations. When the number of DMUs is below the empirical threshold levels, the discriminatory power among the DMUs may weaken, which leads to the data set not being suitable to apply traditional DEA models. In the literature, the lack of discrimination is often referred to as the “curse of dimensionality”. To overcome this drawback, we provide a simple approach to increase the discriminatory power between efficient and inefficient DMUs using the well-known pure DEA model, which considers either inputs only or outputs only. Three real cases, namely printed circuit boards, Greek banks, and quality of life in Fortune's best cities, have been discussed to illustrate the proposed approach.},

abstract = {This article proposes a neural-network approach to predict and simulate human mortality rates. This semi-parametric model is capable to detect and duplicate non-linearities observed in the evolution of log-forces of mortality. The method proceeds in two steps. During the first stage, a neural-network-based generalization of the principal component analysis summarizes the information carried by the surface of log-mortality rates in a small number of latent factors. In the second step, these latent factors are forecast with an econometric model. The term structure of log-forces of mortality is next reconstructed by an inverse transformation. The neural analyzer is adjusted to French, UK and US mortality rates, over the period 1946–2000 and validated with data from 2001 to 2014. Numerical experiments reveal that the neural approach has an excellent predictive power, compared to the Lee–Carter model with and without cohort effects.},

abstract = {In the field of mortality, the Lee–Carter based approach can be considered the milestone to forecast mortality rates among stochastic models. We could define a “Lee–Carter model family” that embraces all developments of this model, including its first formulation (1992) that remains the benchmark for comparing the performance of future models. In the Lee–Carter model, the $\kappa$ t parameter, describing the mortality trend over time, plays an important role about the future mortality behavior. The traditional ARIMA process usually used to model $\kappa$ t shows evident limitations to describe the future mortality shape. Concerning forecasting phase, academics should approach a more plausible way in order to think a nonlinear shape of the projected mortality rates. Therefore, we propose an alternative approach the ARIMA processes based on a deep learning technique. More precisely, in order to catch the pattern of $\kappa$ t series over time more accurately, we apply a Recurrent Neural Network with a Long Short-Term Memory architecture and integrate the Lee–Carter model to improve its predictive capacity. The proposed approach provides significant performance in terms of predictive accuracy and also allow for avoiding the time-chunks' a priori selection. Indeed, it is a common practice among academics to delete the time in which the noise is overflowing or the data quality is insufficient. The strength of the Long Short-Term Memory network lies in its ability to treat this noise and adequately reproduce it into the forecasted trend, due to its own architecture enabling to take into account significant long-term patterns.},

abstract = {Model averaging combines forecasts obtained from a range of models, and it often produces more accurate forecasts than a forecast from a single model. The crucial part of forecast accuracy improvement in using the model averaging lies in the determination of optimal weights from a finite sample. If the weights are selected sub-optimally, this can affect the accuracy of the model-averaged forecasts. Instead of choosing the optimal weights, we consider trimming a set of models before equally averaging forecasts from the selected superior models. Motivated by Hansen, Lunde and Nason (2011), we apply and evaluate the model confidence set procedure when combining mortality forecasts. The proposed model averaging procedure is motivated by Samuels and Sekkel (2017) based on the concept of model confidence sets as proposed by Hansen et al. (2011) that incorporates the statistical significance of the forecasting performance. As the model confidence level increases, the set of superior models generally decreases. The proposed model averaging procedure is demonstrated via national and sub-national Japanese mortality for retirement ages between 60 and 100+. Illustrated by national and sub-national Japanese mortality for ages between 60 and 100+, the proposed model-average procedure gives the smallest interval forecast errors, especially for males. We find that robust out-of-sample point and interval forecasts may be obtained from the trimming method. By robust, we mean robustness against model misspecification.},

abstract = {Comparisons of differential survival by country are useful in many domains. In the area of public policy, they help policymakers and analysts assess how much various groups benefit from public programs, such as social security and health care. In financial markets and especially for actuaries, they are important for designing annuities and life insurance products. This paper presents a method for clustering information about differential mortality by country. The approach is then used to group mortality surfaces for European Union (EU) countries. The aim of this paper is to measure between-group inequality in mortality experience in EU countries through a range of mortality indicators. Additionally, the indicators permit the characterization of each group. It is important to take into account characteristics such as sex; therefore, this study differentiates between males and females in order to detect whether their patterns and characterizations are different. It is concluded that there are clear differences in mortality between the east and west of the EU that are more important than the traditional south–north division, with a significant disadvantage for Eastern Europe, and especially for males in Baltic countries. We find that the mortality indicators have evolved in all countries in such a way that the gap between groups has been maintained, both in terms of the differences in mortality levels and variability.},

abstract = {Providers of life annuities and pensions need to consider both systematic mortality improvement trends and mortality hetero-geneity. Although how mortality improvement varies with age and gender at the population level is well studied, how trends vary with risk factors remains relatively unexplored. This article assesses how systematic mortality improvement trends vary with individual risk characteristics using individual-level longitudinal data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study between 1994 and 2009. Initially a Lee-Carter model is used to assess mortality improvement trends by grouping individuals with similar risk characteristics of gender, education, and race. We then fit a longitudinal mortality model to individual-level data allowing for hetero-geneity and time trends in individual-level risk factors. Our results show how survey data can provide valuable insights into both mortality heterogeneity and improvement trends more effectively than commonly used aggregate models. We show how mortality improvement differs across individuals with different risk factors. Significantly, at an individual level, mortality improvement trends have been driven by changes in health history such as high blood pressure, cancer, and heart problems rather than risk factors such as education, marital status, body mass index, and smoker status.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

abstract = {We develop a Gaussian process ("GP") framework for modeling mortality rates and mortality improvement factors. GP regression is a nonparametric, data-driven approach for determining the spatial dependence in mortality rates and jointly smoothing raw rates across dimensions, such as calendar year and age. The GP model quantifies uncertainty associated with smoothed historical experience and generates full stochastic trajectories for out-of-sample forecasts.  Our framework is well suited for updating projections when newly available data arrives, and for dealing with "edge'' issues where credibility is lower. We present a detailed analysis of Gaussian process model performance for US mortality experience based on the CDC datasets. We investigate the interaction between mean and residual modeling, Bayesian and non-Bayesian GP methodologies, accuracy of in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting, and stability of model parameters. We also document the general decline, along with strong age-dependency, in mortality improvement factors over the past few years, contrasting our findings with the Society of Actuaries ("SOA") MP-2014 and -2015 models that do not fully reflect these recent trends.},

In making social policies and pricing annuity at national and subnational levels, it is important not only to forecast mortality accurately, but also to ensure that forecasts at the subnational level add up to the forecasts at the national level. This motivates recent developments in grouped functional time series methods (Shang and Hyndman, in press) to reconcile age-specific mortality forecasts. We extend these grouped functional time series forecasting methods to multivariate time series, and apply them to produce point forecasts of mortality rates at older ages, from which fixed-term annuities for different ages and maturities can be priced. Using the regional age-specific mortality rates in Japan obtained from the Japanese Mortality Database, we investigate the one-step-ahead to 15-step-ahead point-forecast accuracy between the independent and grouped forecasting methods. The grouped forecasting methods are shown not only to be useful for reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates at national and subnational levels, but they are also shown to allow improved forecast accuracy. The improved forecast accuracy of mortality rates is of great interest to the insurance and pension industries for estimating annuity prices, in particular at the level of population subgroups, defined by key factors such as sex, region, and socioeconomic grouping.},

abstract = {Life expectancy has been increasing sharply around the globe since the second half of the 20th century. Mortality modeling and forecasting have therefore attracted increasing attention from various areas, such as the public pension systems, commercial insurance sectors, as well as actuarial, demographic and epidemiological research. Compared to the aggregate mortality experience, cause-specific mortality rates contain more detailed information, and can help us better understand the ongoing mortality improvements. However, when conducting cause-of-death mortality modeling, it is important to ensure coherence in the forecasts. That is, the forecasts of cause-specific mortality rates should add up to the forecasts of the aggregate mortality rates. In this paper, we propose a novel forecast reconciliation approach to achieve this goal. We use the age-specific mortality experience in the U.S. during 1970–2015 as a case study. Seven major causes of death are considered in this paper. By incorporating both the disaggregate cause-specific data and the aggregate total-level data, we achieve better forecasting results at both levels and coherence across forecasts. Moreover, we perform a cluster analysis on the cause-specific mortality data. It is shown that combining mortality experience from causes with similar mortality patterns can provide additional useful information, and thus further improve forecast accuracy. Finally, based on the proposed reconciliation approach, we conduct a scenario-based analysis to project future mortality rates under the assumption of certain causes being eliminated.},

abstract = {Background In recent decades, considerable research effort has been dedicated to improving mortality forecasting methods. While making valuable contributions to the literature, the bulk of this research has focused on national populations-yet much planning and service delivery occurs at regional and local scales. More attention needs to be paid to subnational mortality forecasting methods. Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate eight fairly simple methods of regional mortality forecasting, focusing specifically on the requirements of practising demographers in government and business. Data and methods Data were sourced primarily from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Retrospective mortality rate forecasts were produced for 88 regions of Australia for 2006-2016. Regional mortality forecast methods were evaluated on the basis of (i) input data requirements, (ii) ease of calculation, (iii) ease of assumption setting and scenario creation, (iv) plausibility of forecast death rates, (v) smoothness of forecast mortality age profiles, and (vi) forecast accuracy. Results Two of the methods produced noticeably higher forecast errors than the others (National Death Rates and SMR Scaling). Five of the methods were judged to be similar in their overall suitability. Two were particularly easy to implement (Broad Age SMR Scaling and Broad Age Rate Ratio Scaling) and provide a good return on the data and effort required. Two others (Brass Relational and Mortality Surface) produced very smooth mortality age profiles and highly plausible death rates, though were relatively more complex to implement. Conclusion The choice of mortality forecasting method is important for the accuracy of regional population forecasts. But considerations additional to accuracy are important, including those relating to the plausibility of the forecasts and the ease of implementation.},

Statisticians would have probably preferred more information about the underlying smoothing methods that were used. Epidemiologists likewise might miss discussions about the etiology of diseases. Sociologists would have probably expected that our results were more embedded into theoretical frameworks.... We are aware of those potential shortcomings but believe that the current format can, nevertheless, provide interesting insights intomortality dynamics, and we hope our book can serve as a starting point to visualize data on the Lexis plane for those who have not used those techniques yet.},

abstract = {This paper proposes and calibrates a consistent multi-factor affine term structure mortality model for longevity risk applications. We show that this model is appropriate for fitting historical mortality rates. Without traded mortality instruments the choice of risk-neutral measure is not unique and we fit it to observed historical mortality rates in our framework. We show that the risk-neutral parameters can be calibrated and are relatively insensitive of the historical period chosen. Importantly, the framework provides consistent future survival curves with the same parametric form as the initial curve in the risk-neutral measure. The multiple risk factors allow for applications in pricing and more general risk management problems. A state-space representation is used to estimate parameters for the model with the Kalman filter. A measurement error variance is included for each age to capture the effect of sample population size. Swedish mortality data is used to assess 2- and 3-factor implementations of the model. A 3-factor model specification is shown to provide a good fit to the observed survival curves, especially for older ages. Bootstrapping is used to derive parameter estimate distributions and residual analysis is used to confirm model fit. We use the Heath-Jarrow-Morton forward rate framework to verify consistency and to simulate cohort survivor curves under the risk-neutral measure. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper presents the optimal continuous time dynamic consumption and portfolio choice for pooled annuity funds. A pooled annuity fund constitutes an alternative way to protect against mortality risk compared to purchasing a life annuity. The crucial difference between the pooled annuity fund and purchase of a life annuity offered by an insurance company is that participants of a pooled annuity fund still have to bear some mortality risk while insured annuitants bear no mortality risk at all. The population of the pool is modelled by employing a Poisson process with time-dependent hazard-rate. It follows that the pool member's optimization problem has to account for the stochastic investment horizon and for jumps in wealth which occur if another pool member dies. In case the number of pool members goes to infinity analytical solutions are provided. For finite pool sizes the solution of the optimization problem is reduced to the numerical solution of a set of ODEs. A simulation and welfare analysis show that pooled annuity funds insure very effectively against longevity risk even if their pool size is rather small. Only very risk averse investors or those without access to small pools are more inclined to pay a risk premium to access private life annuity markets in order to lay off mortality risk completely. As even families constitute such small pools the model provides theoretical justification for the low empirical annuity demand. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In the first case, we apply the non-linear least squares method to cross sectional data (i.e., all rates of a single day). In the second case, we consider the short rate obtained by means of the first procedure as a proxy of the real market short rate. Starting from this new proxy, we evaluate the parameters of the CIR model by means of martingale estimation techniques. The estimate of the market price of risk is provided by comparing results obtained with these two techniques, since this approach makes possible to isolate the market price of risk and evaluate, under the Local Expectations Hypothesis, the risk premium given by the market for different maturities. As a test case, we apply the method to data of the European Fixed Income Market. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The distinguishing risk diffusion characteristic of GSAs in the family of longevity insurance instruments is that the annuitants bear their systematic risk, but the pool shares idiosyncratic risk. This obviates the need for an insurance company, although such instruments could be sold through a corporate insurer. We begin by deriving the payout adjustment for a single entry group with a single annuity factor and constant expectations. We then show that under weak requirements a unique solution to payout paths exists when multiple cohorts combine into a single pool. This relies on the harmonic mean of the ratio of realized to expected survivorship rates across cohorts. The case of evolving expectations is also analyzed. In all cases, we demonstrate that the periodic-benefit payment in a pooled annuity fund is determined based on the previous payment adjusted for any deviations in mortality and interest from expectations. GSA may have considerable appeal in countries which have adopted national defined contribution schemes and/or in which the life insurance industry is noncompetitive or poorly developed.},

abstract = {Designing post retirement benefits requires access to appropriate
investment instruments to manage the interest rate and longevity risks.
Post retirement benefits are increasingly taken as a form of income
benefit, either as a pension or an annuity. Pension funds and life
insurers offer annuities generating long term liabilities linked to
longevity. Risk management of life annuity portfolios for interest rate
risks is well developed but the incorporation of longevity risk has
received limited attention. We develop an immunization approach and a
delta-gamma based hedging approach to manage the risks of adverse
portfolio surplus using stochastic models for mortality and interest
rates. We compare and assess the immunization and hedge effectiveness of
fixed-income coupon bonds, annuity bonds, as well as longevity bonds,
using simulations of the portfolio surplus for an annuity portfolio and
a range of risk measures including value-at-risk. We show how
fixed-income annuity bonds can more effectively match cash flows and
provide additional hedge effectiveness over coupon bonds. Longevity
bonds, including deferred longevity bonds, reduce risk significantly
compared to coupon and annuity bonds, reflecting the long duration of
the typical life annuity and the exposure to longevity risk. Longevity
bonds are shown to be effective in immunizing surplus over short and
long horizons. Delta gamma hedging is generally only effective over
short horizons. The results of the paper have implications for how
providers of post retirement income benefit streams can manage risks in
demanding conditions where innovation in investment markets can support
new products and increase the product range.},

abstract = {Importance In the United States, regional variation in cardiovascular mortality is well-known but county-level estimates for all major cardiovascular conditions have not been produced. Objective To estimate age-standardized mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases by county. Design and Setting Deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics and population counts from the US Census Bureau, the National Center for Health Statistics, and the Human Mortality Database from 1980 through 2014 were used. Validated small area estimation models were used to estimate county-level mortality rates from all cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation and flutter, rheumatic heart disease, aortic aneurysm, peripheral arterial disease, endocarditis, and all other cardiovascular diseases combined. Exposures The 3110 counties of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures Age-standardized cardiovascular disease mortality rates by county, year, sex, and cause. Results From 1980 to 2014, cardiovascular diseases were the leading cause of death in the United States, although the mortality rate declined from 507.4 deaths per 100 000 persons in 1980 to 252.7 deaths per 100 000 persons in 2014, a relative decline of 50.2{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI], 49.5{\%}-50.8{\%}). In 2014, cardiovascular diseases accounted for more than 846 000 deaths (95{\%} UI, 827-865 thousand deaths) and 11.7 million years of life lost (95{\%} UI, 11.6-11.9 million years of life lost). The gap in age-standardized cardiovascular disease mortality rates between counties at the 10th and 90th percentile declined 14.6{\%} from 172.1 deaths per 100 000 persons in 1980 to 147.0 deaths per 100 000 persons in 2014 (posterior probability of decline {\textgreater}99.9{\%}). In 2014, the ratio between counties at the 90th and 10th percentile was 2.0 for ischemic heart disease (119.1 vs 235.7 deaths per 100 000 persons) and 1.7 for cerebrovascular disease (40.3 vs 68.1 deaths per 100 000 persons). For other cardiovascular disease causes, the ratio ranged from 1.4 (aortic aneurysm: 3.5 vs 5.1 deaths per 100 000 persons) to 4.2 (hypertensive heart disease: 4.3 vs 17.9 deaths per 100 000 persons). The largest concentration of counties with high cardiovascular disease mortality extended from southeastern Oklahoma along the Mississippi River Valley to eastern Kentucky. Several cardiovascular disease conditions were clustered substantially outside the South, including atrial fibrillation (Northwest), aortic aneurysm (Midwest), and endocarditis (Mountain West and Alaska). The lowest cardiovascular mortality rates were found in the counties surrounding San Francisco, California, central Colorado, northern Nebraska, central Minnesota, northeastern Virginia, and southern Florida. Conclusions and Relevance Substantial differences exist between county ischemic heart disease and stroke mortality rates. Smaller differences exist for diseases of the myocardium, atrial fibrillation, aortic and peripheral arterial disease, rheumatic heart disease, and endocarditis.},

There is intense interest in the United States in using social determinants of health to direct clinical and community health interventions, and to adjust quality measures and payments. The United Kingdom and New Zealand use data representing aspects of material and social deprivation from their censuses or from administrative data sets to construct indices designed to measure socioeconomic variation across communities, assess community needs, inform research, adjust clinical funding, allocate community resources, and determine policy impact. Indices provide these countries with comparable data and serve as a universal language and tool set to define organizing principles for population health. In this article we examine how these countries develop, validate, and operationalize their indices; explore their use in policy; and propose the development of a similar deprivation index for the United States.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Understanding the major health problems in the United States and how they are changing over time is critical for informing national health policy.$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To measure the burden of diseases, injuries, and leading risk factors in the United States from 1990 to 2010 and to compare these measurements with those of the 34 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.$\backslash$nDESIGN: We used the systematic analysis of descriptive epidemiology of 291 diseases and injuries, 1160 sequelae of these diseases and injuries, and 67 risk factors or clusters of risk factors from 1990 to 2010 for 187 countries developed for the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study to describe the health status of the United States and to compare US health outcomes with those of 34 OECD countries. Years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) were computed by multiplying the number of deaths at each age by a reference life expectancy at that age. Years lived with disability (YLDs) were calculated by multiplying prevalence (based on systematic reviews) by the disability weight (based on population-based surveys) for each sequela; disability in this study refers to any short- or long-term loss of health. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. Deaths and DALYs related to risk factors were based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses of exposure data and relative risks for risk-outcome pairs. Healthy life expectancy (HALE) was used to summarize overall population health, accounting for both length of life and levels of ill health experienced at different ages.$\backslash$nRESULTS: US life expectancy for both sexes combined increased from 75.2 years in 1990 to 78.2 years in 2010; during the same period, HALE increased from 65.8 years to 68.1 years. The diseases and injuries with the largest number of YLLs in 2010 were ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and road injury. Age-standardized YLL rates increased for Alzheimer disease, drug use disorders, chronic kidney disease, kidney cancer, and falls. The diseases with the largest number of YLDs in 2010 were low back pain, major depressive disorder, other musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety disorders. As the US population has aged, YLDs have comprised a larger share of DALYs than have YLLs. The leading risk factors related to DALYs were dietary risks, tobacco smoking, high body mass index, high blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Among 34 OECD countries between 1990 and 2010, the US rank for the age-standardized death rate changed from 18th to 27th, for the age-standardized YLL rate from 23rd to 28th, for the age-standardized YLD rate from 5th to 6th, for life expectancy at birth from 20th to 27th, and for HALE from 14th to 26th.$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: From 1990 to 2010, the United States made substantial progress in improving health. Life expectancy at birth and HALE increased, all-cause death rates at all ages decreased, and age-specific rates of years lived with disability remained stable. However, morbidity and chronic disability now account for nearly half of the US health burden, and improvements in population health in the United States have not kept pace with advances in population health in other wealthy nations.},

abstract = {Background Health outcomes are known to vary at both the country and local levels, but trends in mortality across a detailed and comprehensive set of causes have not been previously described at a very local level. Life expectancy in King County, WA, USA, is in the 95th percentile among all counties in the USA. However, little is known about how life expectancy and mortality from different causes of death vary at a local, neighbourhood level within this county. In this analysis, we estimated life expectancy and cause-specific mortality within King County to describe spatial trends, quantify disparities in mortality, and assess the contribution of each cause of death to overall disparities in all-cause mortality. Methods We applied established so-called garbage code redistribution algorithms and small area estimation methods to death registration data for King County to estimate life expectancy, cause-specific mortality rates, and years of life lost (YLL) rates from 152 causes of death for 397 census tracts from Jan 1, 1990, to Dec 31, 2014. We used the cause list developed for the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study for this analysis. Deaths were tabulated by age group, sex, census tract, and cause of death. We used Bayesian mixed-effects regression models to estimate mortality overall and from each cause. Findings Between 1990 and 2014, life expectancy in King County increased by 5{\textperiodcentered}4 years (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 5{\textperiodcentered}0–5{\textperiodcentered}7) among men (from 74{\textperiodcentered}0 years [73{\textperiodcentered}7–74{\textperiodcentered}3] to 79{\textperiodcentered}3 years [79{\textperiodcentered}1–79{\textperiodcentered}6]) and by 3{\textperiodcentered}4 years (3{\textperiodcentered}0–3{\textperiodcentered}7) among women (from 80{\textperiodcentered}0 years [79{\textperiodcentered}7–80{\textperiodcentered}2] to 83{\textperiodcentered}3 years [83{\textperiodcentered}1–83{\textperiodcentered}5]). In 2014, life expectancy ranged from 68{\textperiodcentered}4 years (95{\%} UI 66{\textperiodcentered}9–70{\textperiodcentered}1) to 86{\textperiodcentered}7 years (85{\textperiodcentered}0–88{\textperiodcentered}2) for men and from 73{\textperiodcentered}6 years (71{\textperiodcentered}6–75{\textperiodcentered}5) to 88{\textperiodcentered}4 years (86{\textperiodcentered}9–89{\textperiodcentered}9) for women among census tracts within King County. Rates of YLL by cause also varied substantially among census tracts for each cause of death. Geographical areas with relatively high and relatively low YLL rates differed by cause. In general, causes of death responsible for more YLLs overall also contributed more significantly to geographical inequality within King County. However, certain causes contributed more to inequality than to overall YLLs. Interpretation This census tract-level analysis of life expectancy and cause-specific YLL rates highlights important differences in health among neighbourhoods in King County that are masked by county-level estimates. Efforts to improve population health in King County should focus on reducing geographical inequality, by targeting those health conditions that contribute the most to overall YLLs and to inequality. This analysis should be replicated in other locations to more fully describe fine-grained local-level variation in population health and contribute to efforts to improve health while reducing inequalities.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examined the extent to which area- and individual-level socioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular-disease (CVD), heart disease, and stroke mortality among United States men and women aged 25-64 years changed between 1969 and 2011. METHODS: National vital statistics data and the National Longitudinal Mortality Study were used to estimate area- and individual-level socioeconomic gradients in mortality over time. Rate ratios and log-linear and Cox regression were used to model mortality trends and differentials. RESULTS: Area socioeconomic gradients in mortality from CVD, heart disease, and stroke increased substantially during the study period. Compared to those in the most affluent group, individuals in the most deprived area group had, respectively 35{\%}, 29{\%}, and 73{\%} higher CVD, heart disease, and stroke mortality in 1969, but 120-121{\%} higher mortality in 2007-2011. Gradients were steeper for women than for men. Education, income, and occupation were inversely associated with CVD, heart disease, and stroke mortality, with individual-level socioeconomic gradients being steeper during 1990-2002 than in 1979-1989. Individuals with low education and incomes had 2.7 to 3.7 times higher CVD, heart disease, and stroke mortality risks than their counterparts with high education and income levels. CONCLUSIONS AND GLOBAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS: Although mortality declined for all US groups during 1969-2011, socioeconomic disparities in mortality from CVD, heart disease and stroke remained marked and increased over time because of faster declines in mortality among higher socioeconomic groups. Widening disparities in mortality may reflect increasing temporal areal inequalities in living conditions, behavioral risk factors such as smoking, obesity and physical inactivity, and access to and use of health services. With social inequalities and prevalence of smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity on the rise, most segments of the working-age population in low- and middle-income countries will likely experience increased cardiovascular-disease burden in terms of higher morbidity and mortality rates.},

This information is potentially useful for policy makers, clinicians, and researchers seeking to reduce disparities and increase longevity. Objective To estimate annual life tables by county from 1980 to 2014; describe trends in geographic inequalities in life expectancy and age-specific risk of death; and assess the proportion of variation in life expectancy explained by variation in socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Design, Setting, and Participants Annual county-level life tables were constructed using small area estimation methods from deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and population counts from the US Census Bureau, NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database. Measures of geographic inequality in life expectancy and age-specific mortality risk were calculated. Principal component analysis and ordinary least squares regression were used to examine the county-level association between life expectancy and socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Exposures County of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures Life expectancy at birth and age-specific mortality risk. Results Counties were combined as needed to create stable units of analysis over the period 1980 to 2014, reducing the number of areas analyzed from 3142 to 3110. In 2014, life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 79.1 (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI], 79.0-79.1) years overall, but differed by 20.1 (95{\%} UI, 19.1-21.3) years between the counties with the lowest and highest life expectancy. Absolute geographic inequality in life expectancy increased between 1980 and 2014. Over the same period, absolute geographic inequality in the risk of death decreased among children and adolescents, but increased among older adults. Socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors explained 60{\%}, 74{\%}, and 27{\%} of county-level variation in life expectancy, respectively. Combined, these factors explained 74{\%} of this variation. Most of the association between socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors and life expectancy was mediated through behavioral and metabolic risk factors. Conclusions and Relevance Geographic disparities in life expectancy among US counties are large and increasing. Much of the variation in life expectancy among counties can be explained by a combination of socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Policy action targeting socioeconomic factors and behavioral and metabolic risk factors may help reverse the trend of increasing disparities in life expectancy in the United States.},

To appeal to as many potential readers as possible, we do not require any specialist knowledge. This approach may be disappointing: Demographers may have liked more information about the mathematical underpinnings of population dynamics on the Lexis surface as demonstrated, for instance, by Arthur and Vaupel in 1984. Statisticians would have probably preferred more information about the underlying smoothing methods that were used. Epidemiologists likewise might miss discussions about the etiology of diseases. Sociologists would have probably expected that our results were more embedded into theoretical frameworks.... We are aware of those potential shortcomings but believe that the current format can, nevertheless, provide interesting insights intomortality dynamics, and we hope our book can serve as a starting point to visualize data on the Lexis plane for those who have not used those techniques yet.},

Using Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data and accounting for longevity risk pooling within marriage and preannuitized wealth, we find substantial redistribution away from disadvantaged groups in expected utility terms. Using HRS data on subjective survival probabilities, we construct a subjective life table for each individual in the HRS. We calculate the value each household would place on annuitization, based on the husband and wife's subjective life tables, and the household's degree of risk aversion and proportion of preannuitized wealth. A significant minority would perceive themselves as suffering a loss from mandatory annuitization.

abstract = {In this article we formulate and solve the optimal design problem of a de ned contribution public pension fund, in a highly stylized but still rather general non stationary framework. We adopt the viewpoint of a benevolent social planner who aims at treating in a fair manner the succes- sive overlapping generations participating to such a long-term mandatory system. Using the approach of El Karoui and Jeanblanc (1998) for the optimal consumption and portfolio choice problem with random income in a complete market, we exhibit a solution to our intertemporal stochastic control problem where each generation receives a fair (lumpsum) retire- ment bene t: it is proportional to the contributions she has paid during her active worklife and follows a xed common rule (although her pension value itself may depend on variables only observable at her retirement time). We next relax the assumption that the collective pension system is mandatory and investigate the performance of individual investment plans in the market. Comparing the outcomes of both alternatives, we derive a condition under which the collective fund can be expected to overperform the individual plan. In the special case of a stationary econ- omy, such a possibility has been pointed out by Gollier (2008). In fact this e ect results from the possibility for the collective fund to borrow today against contributions of future generations, which allows to implement riskier strategies and may improve its performance.},

This is especially important for product developments including target-date portfolios and variable annuities where volatility management is critical. Empirical evidence shows asymmetry between equity market return and volatility, with returns and conditional volatility negatively correlated. We develop an approach that targets constant volatility in equity market portfolios and assess its performance with U.S., U.K., German and Australian data focusing on long term accumulation investment strategies popular with DC pension plans. Our approach to volatility management is univariate, in contrast to most of the existing approaches in the literature that are multivariate and more complex. Of particular relevance to pension funds is that we show substantial risk adjusted outperformance (in the range of an additional 100 to 350 basis points on average) relative to stock market index benchmarks, after transaction costs. Other features of the targeted constant volatility portfolios, relevant to insurers and pension funds, are a significantly reduced exposure to stock market crashes and low transaction costs relative to other approaches.},

abstract = {At retirement, most individuals face a choice between voluntary annuitization and discretionary management of assets with systematic withdrawals for consumption purposes. Annuitization–buying a life annuity from an insurance company–assures a lifelong consumption stream that cannot be outlived, but it is at the expense of a complete loss of liquidity. On the other hand, discretionary management and consumption from assets–self-annuitization–preserves flexibility but with the distinct risk that a constant standard of living will not be maintainable. In this paper we compute the lifetime and eventual probability of ruin (PoR) for an individual who wishes to consume a fixed periodic amount–a self-constructed annuity–from an initial endowment invested in a portfolio earning a stochastic (lognormal) rate of return. The lifetime PoR is the probability that net wealth will hit zero prior to a stochastic date of death. The eventual PoR is the probability that net wealth will ever hit zero for an infinitely lived individual. We demonstrate that the probability of ruin can be represented as the probability that the stochastic present value (SPV) of consumption is greater than the initial investable wealth. The lifetime and eventual probabilities of ruin are then obtained by evaluating one minus the cumulative density function of the SPV at the initial wealth level. In that eventual case, we offer a precise analytical solution because the SPV is known to be a reciprocal gamma distribution. For the lifetime case, using the Gompertz law of mortality, we provide two approximations. Both involve “moment matching” techniques that are motivated by results in Arithmetic Asian option pricing theory. We verify the accuracy of these approximations using Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, a numerical case study is provided using Canadian mortality and capital market parameters. It appears that the lifetime probability of ruin–for a consumption rate that is equal to the life annuity payout–is at its lowest with a well-diversified portfolio. {\textcopyright} 2000 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Most indices for longevity risk are age-period based. We develop and assess a cohort-based value index for life insurers and pension funds to manage longevity risk. There are two innovations in the development of this index. Firstly, the underlying variables of most existing longevity indices are based on mortality experience only. The value index is based on the present value of future cash flow obligations, capturing all the risks in retirement income products. We use the index to manage both longevity risk and interest rate risk. Secondly, we capture historical dependencies between ages and cohorts with a cohort-based stochastic mortality model. We achieve this by introducing age-dependent model parameters. With our mortality model, we obtain realistic cohort correlation structures and improve the fitting performance, particularly for very old ages.},

Collectively, the structures are called pooled annuity funds. Since the pooled annuity funds propose different methods of pooling mortality risk, we investigate the connections between them and find that they are genuinely different for a finite heterogeneous membership profile. We discuss the importance of actuarial fairness, defined as the expected benefits equalling the contributions for each member, in the context of pooling mortality risk and comment on whether actuarial unfairness can be seen as solidarity between members. We show that, with a finite number of members in the fund, the group self-annuitization scheme is not actuarially fair: some members subsidize the other members. The implication is that the members who are subsidizing the others may obtain a higher expected benefit by joining a fund with a more favorable membership profile. However, we find that the subsidies are financially significant only for very small or highly heterogeneous membership profiles.},

An earlier paper by Piggott et al. [Piggott, J., Valdez, E.A., Detzel, B., 2005. The simple analytics of a pooled annuity fund. J. Risk Insur. 72, 497-520] provides a formal analysis of the payout adjustments from a longevity risk-pooling fund, an arrangement referred to in the paper as Group Self Annuitization (GSA). In such a pooled arrangement, the annuitants will bear their own cohorts' systematic risk, but the cohort will share the idiosyncratic risk. The resulting return on the pooled annuity fund can be expressed as the product of a return from an ordinary annuity multiplied by a random variable that accounts for the adjustment that is due to deviations from expectation of mortality and investments. As demonstrated in this paper, a simple analysis of economic choice provides that it is possible to reduce the implications of adverse selection in a pooled annuity fund. It is well-documented that empirically, individuals do not find private annuity funds an attractive form of investment despite the potential welfare benefits that can be drawn from annuitization. A pooled annuity fund is an alternative to the conventional private annuity fund that may be considered more cost-effective. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Aggregate population mortality trends have shown significant improvement over long periods of time. Individual mortality heterogeneity arises from differing risk characteristics across individuals. This paper assesses the extent that systematic mortality improvement varies with individual risk characteristics. To do this, a Lee-Carter model is used to assess if mortality improvement varies for groups of individuals with similar risk characteristics along with an individual mortality model that allows for heterogeneity with time trends to assess systematic risk. Data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is used since this provides longitudinal, individual level data. Our results are highly relevant to life insurers, pension funds and regulators assessing the future impact of improvement trends in mortality on their premiums and liabilities. Mortality trends differ across individuals reflecting the different risk factors and particularly the prevalence of different diseases such as high blood pressure, cancer and heart problems. Models that are based on aggregate population level trends and differing only by gender and age are not adequate in quantifying mortality trends and risks.},

abstract = {There is growing interest in the design of pension annuities that insure against idiosyncratic longevity risk while pooling and sharing systematic risk. This is partially motivated by the desire to reduce capital and reserve requirements while retaining the value of mortality credits; see for example, Piggott et al. (2005) or Donnelly et al. (2014). In this paper, we generalize the natural retirement income tontine introduced by Milevsky and Salisbury (2015) by combining heterogeneous cohorts into one pool. We engineer this scheme by allocating tontine shares at either a premium or a discount to par based on both the age of the investor and the amount they invest. For example, a 55-year old allocating {\$}10,000 to the tontine might be told to pay {\$}200 per share and receive 50 shares, while a 75-year old allocating {\$}8,000 might pay {\$}40 per share and receive 200 shares. They would all be mixed together into the same tontine pool and each tontine share would have equal income rights. The current paper addresses existence and uniqueness issues and discusses the conditions under which this scheme can be constructed equitably — which is distinct from fairly — even though it isn't optimal for any cohort. As such, this also gives us the opportunity to compare and contrast various pooling schemes that have been proposed in the literature and to differentiate between arrangements that are socially equitable, vs. actuarially fair vs. economically optimal.},

These can only be estimated in a reliable way from a sufficiently large historical dataset for such portfolios, which is often not available. We overcome this problem by introducing a model to estimate portfolio-specific mortality simultaneously with population mortality. By using a Bayesian framework, we automatically generate the appropriate weighting for the limited statistical information in a given portfolio and the more extensive information that is available for the whole population. This allows us to separate parameter uncertainty from uncertainty due to the randomness in individual deaths for a given realization of mortality rates. When we apply our method to a dataset of assured lives in England and Wales, we find that different prior specifications for the portfolio-specific factors lead to significantly different posterior distributions for hazard rates. However, in short-term predictive distributions for future numbers of deaths, individual mortality risk turns out to be more important than parameter uncertainty in the portfolio-specific factors, both for large and for small portfolios.},

In making social policies and pricing annuity at national and subnational levels, it is important not only to forecast mortality accurately, but also to ensure that forecasts at the subnational level add up to the forecasts at the national level. This motivates recent developments in grouped functional time series methods (Shang and Hyndman, in press) to reconcile age-specific mortality forecasts. We extend these grouped functional time series forecasting methods to multivariate time series, and apply them to produce point forecasts of mortality rates at older ages, from which fixed-term annuities for different ages and maturities can be priced. Using the regional age-specific mortality rates in Japan obtained from the Japanese Mortality Database, we investigate the one-step-ahead to 15-step-ahead point-forecast accuracy between the independent and grouped forecasting methods. The grouped forecasting methods are shown not only to be useful for reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates at national and subnational levels, but they are also shown to allow improved forecast accuracy. The improved forecast accuracy of mortality rates is of great interest to the insurance and pension industries for estimating annuity prices, in particular at the level of population subgroups, defined by key factors such as sex, region, and socioeconomic grouping.},

abstract = {We analyze a pooled annuity fund from a participant's perspective by comparing it to a mortality-linked fund, a type of variable payout life annuity, that gives a return linked to the force of mortality but subject to a cost. Fixing the instantaneous volatility of return on wealth, we find that the expected return on the pooled annuity fund is higher except when the costs are very low in the mortality-linked fund. Similar results are obtained when maximizing the expected lifetime utility of consumption, assuming a constant relative risk aversion utility function. In both settings, our results indicate that a participant may be willing to accept the mortality risk of the pooled annuity fund, even when only 100 individuals are pooling their mortality in the pooled annuity fund. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Is it the healthy retiree who expects to live long and might become a centenarian, or is the unhealthy retiree with a short life expectancy more likely to appreciate the pooling of longevity risk? What if the unhealthy retiree is pooled with someone who is much healthier and forced to pay an implicit loading? To answer these and related questions this paper examines the empirical conditions under which retirees benefit (or may not) from longevity risk pooling by linking the economics of annuity equivalent wealth to actuarially models of aging. I focus attention on the Compensation Law of Mortality which implies that individuals with higher relative mortality (e.g., lower income) age more slowly and experience greater longevity uncertainty. Ergo, they place higher utility value on the annuity. The impetus for this research today is the increasing evidence on the growing disparity in longevity expectations between rich and poor.},

abstract = {There is growing interest in the design of pension annuities that insure against idiosyncratic longevity risk while pooling and sharing systematic risk. This is partially motivated by the desire to reduce capital and reserve requirements while retaining the value of mortality credits; see for example, Piggott et al. (2005) or Donnelly et al. (2014). In this paper, we generalize the natural retirement income tontine introduced by Milevsky and Salisbury (2015) by combining heterogeneous cohorts into one pool. We engineer this scheme by allocating tontine shares at either a premium or a discount to par based on both the age of the investor and the amount they invest. For example, a 55-year old allocating {\$}10,000 to the tontine might be told to pay {\$}200 per share and receive 50 shares, while a 75-year old allocating {\$}8,000 might pay {\$}40 per share and receive 200 shares. They would all be mixed together into the same tontine pool and each tontine share would have equal income rights. The current paper addresses existence and uniqueness issues and discusses the conditions under which this scheme can be constructed equitably - which is distinct from fairly - even though it isn't optimal for any cohort. As such, this also gives us the opportunity to compare and contrast various pooling schemes that have been proposed in the literature and to differentiate between arrangements that are socially equitable, vs. actuarially fair vs. economically optimal.},

Our simulations are based on a rep- resentative sample of the Italian population consisting of individuals born between 1975 and 2000. We identify three channels of redistribution: between genders (from men to women), along educational lines (from the less-well-educated to the highly educated) and between di- verse lifetime-earnings quintiles (from the poor to the rich). This happens because certain groups of individuals systematically live shorter-than-average lives (men, the less well-educated and the poor), whereas others live longer-than-average lives (women, the highly educated and the rich) and, at the same time, the NDC system does not take into account such differences. Comparison between the old defined benefit system and the reformed NDC one shows that intergenerational fairness has improved sensibly but differences between gender and edu- cational levels remained nearly the same. Sensitivity analysis and the consideration of survival pensions in our simulations confirm the general trends of our base case.},

Systematic risk cannot be readily diversified in an insurance pool or pension fund. It is an important factor in assessing solvency and highlighting the tail risk in longevity insurance and pension products. Idiosyncratic risk can be diversified in typical pool sizes, although less effectively at the older ages. Mortality heterogeneity is not usually taken into account in stochastic mortality models. This is a mortality risk that reduces the effectiveness of idiosyncratic mortality risk pooling. Heterogeneity has been modeled with frailty models and more recently with Markov multiple state ageing models. This paper overviews recent developments in models for mortality heterogeneity and uses a model calibrated to both population mortality and health condition data to consider the impact of model risk and heterogeneity in assessing solvency and tail risk for longevity risk products.},

The distinguishing risk diffusion characteristic of GSAs in the family of longevity insurance instruments is that the annuitants bear their systematic risk, but the pool shares idiosyncratic risk. This obviates the need for an insurance company, although such instruments could be sold through a corporate insurer. We begin by deriving the payout adjustment for a single entry group with a single annuity factor and constant expectations. We then show that under weak requirements a unique solution to payout paths exists when multiple cohorts combine into a single pool. This relies on the harmonic mean of the ratio of realized to expected survivorship rates across cohorts. The case of evolving expectations is also analyzed. In all cases, we demonstrate that the periodic-benefit payment in a pooled annuity fund is determined based on the previous payment adjusted for any deviations in mortality and interest from expectations. GSA may have considerable appeal in countries which have adopted national defined contribution schemes and/or in which the life insurance industry is noncompetitive or poorly developed.},

abstract = {EU Gender Directive ruled out discrimination against gender in charging premium for insurance products. This prohibition prevents the use of the standard actuarial fairness principle to price life insurance products. According to current actuarial practice, unisex premiums are calculated with a simple weighting rule of the gender-specific life tables. This procedure is likely to violate portfolio fairness principles. Up to our knowledge, in the actuarial literature there is no unisex mortality model that respects the unisex fairness principle. This paper is the first attempt to fill this gap. First, we recall the notion of unisex fairness principle and the corresponding unisex fair premium. Then, we provide a unisex stochastic mortality model for the mortality intensity that is underlying the pricing of a life portfolio of females and males belonging to the same cohort. Finally, we calibrate the unisex mortality model using the unisex fairness principle. We find that the weighting coefficient between the males' and females' own mortalities depends mainly on the quote of portfolio relative to each gender, on the age, and on the type of insurance products. The knowledge of a proper unisex mortality model could help life insurance companies to better understanding the nature of the risk of a mixed portfolio.},

The difficulty of forecasting high-dimensional functional time series lies in the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a novel method to solve this problem. Dynamic functional principal component analysis is first applied to reduce each functional time series to a vector. We then use the factor model as a further dimension reduction technique so that only a small number of latent factors are preserved. Classic time series models can be used to forecast the factors and conditional forecasts of the functions can be constructed. Asymptotic properties of the approximated functions are established, including both estimation error and forecast error. The proposed method is easy to implement, especially when the dimension of the functional time series is large. We show the superiority of our approach by both simulation studies and an application to Japanese age-specific mortality rates.},

abstract = {Background: Model averaging combines forecasts obtained from a range of models, and it often produces more accurate forecasts than a forecast from a single model. Objective: The crucial part of forecast accuracy improvement in using the model averaging lies in the determination of optimal weights from a finite sample. If the weights are selected sub-optimally, this can affect the accuracy of the model-averaged forecasts. Instead of choosing the optimal weights, we consider trimming a set of models before equally averaging forecasts from the selected superior models. Motivated by Hansen et al. (Econometrica 79(2):453–497, 2011), we apply and evaluate the model confidence set procedure when combining mortality forecasts. Data and methods: The proposed model averaging procedure is motivated by Samuels and Sekkel (International Journal of Forecasting 33(1):48–60, 2017) based on the concept of model confidence sets as proposed by Hansen et al. (Econometrica 79(2):453–497, 2011) that incorporates the statistical significance of the forecasting performance. As the model confidence level increases, the set of superior models generally decreases. The proposed model averaging procedure is demonstrated via national and sub-national Japanese mortality for retirement ages between 60 and 100+. Results: Illustrated by national and sub-national Japanese mortality for ages between 60 and 100+, the proposed model-averaged procedure gives the smallest interval forecast errors, especially for males. Conclusion: We find that robust out-of-sample point and interval forecasts may be obtained from the trimming method. By robust, we mean robustness against model misspecification.},

This requires consideration of both interest rate and mortality risks in multiple countries. For this purpose, we develop value-based longevity indexes for multiple cohorts in two different countries that take into account the major sources of risks impacting life insurance portfolios, mortality and interest rates. To construct the indexes we propose a cohort-based affine model for multi-country mortality and use an arbitrage-free multi-country Nelson–Siegel model for the dynamics of interest rates. Index-based longevity hedging strategies have the advantages of efficiency, liquidity and lower cost but introduce basis risk. Graphical risk metrics are a way to effectively capture the relationship between an insurer's portfolio and hedging strategies. We illustrate the effectiveness of using a value-based index for longevity risk management between two countries using graphical basis risk metrics. To show the impact of both interest rate and mortality risk we use Australia and the UK as domestic and foreign countries, and, to show the impact of mortality only, we use the male populations of the Netherlands and France with common interest rates and basis risk arising only from differences in mortality risks.},

It offers a blueprint for an efficient and resilient financial system over the next 10 to 20 years, characterised by the fair treatment of users. The Inquiry has made 44 recommendations relating to the Australian financial system. These recommendations reflect the Inquiry's judgement and are based on evidence received by the Inquiry. The Inquiry's test has been one of public interest: the interests of individuals, businesses, the economy, taxpayers and Government. Australia's financial system has performed well since the Wallis Inquiry and has many strong characteristics. It also has a number of weaknesses: taxation and regulatory settings distort the flow of funding to the real economy; it remains susceptible to financial shocks; superannuation is not delivering retirement incomes efficiently; unfair consumer outcomes remain prevalent; and policy settings do not focus on the benefits of competition and innovation. As a result, the system is prone to calls for more regulation. To put these issues in context, the Overview first deals with the characteristics of Australia's economy. It then describes the characteristics of and prerequisites for a well-functioning financial system and the Inquiry's philosophy of financial regulation. The Inquiry focuses on seven themes in this report (summarised in Guide to the Financial System Inquiry Final Report). The Overview deals with the general themes of funding the Australian economy and competition. The Inquiry has also made recommendations on five specific themes, which comprise the next chapters of this report: * Strengthen the economy by making the financial system more resilient. * Lift the value of the superannuation system and retirement incomes. * Drive economic growth and productivity through settings that promote innovation * Enhance confidence and trust by creating an environment in which financial firms treat customers fairly. * Enhance regulator independence and accountability, and minimise the need for future regulation. These recommendations seek to improve efficiency, resilience and fair treatment in the Australian financial system, allowing it to achieve its potential in supporting economic growth and enhancing standards of living for current and future generations.},

abstract = {Heterogeneity in mortality is due to differences among the individuals, which are caused by various risk factors. Some risk factors are observable while others are unobservable. The set of observable risk factors clearly depends on the type of population addressed. The impact of observable risk factors on individual mortality, in particular when they also constitute “rating factors” in the calculation of premiums and other actuarial values, is usually expressed approximately, according to some pragmatic approach. For example, additive or multiplicative adjustments to the average age-specific mortality are frequently adopted. Heterogeneity due to unobservable risk factors can conversely be expressed by adopting the concept of individual “frailty”, which, however, can be interpreted and consequently modeled in several ways, according to the causes which are considered as originating the frailty itself: congenital characteristics, environmental features, lifestyle aspects, etc. In this paper, we provide a survey of scientific contributions on heterogeneity in mortality, focusing on modeling both observable and unobservable heterogeneity. We start with an overview of methodological contributions to heterogeneity and frailty modeling, coming from both the demographical and the actuarial context. We then shift to contributions analyzing the impact of frailty, in its various interpretations, on the results (cash flows, profits, etc.) of life insurance and life annuity portfolios and related risk profiles.},

abstract = {This paper presents the optimal continuous time dynamic consumption and portfolio choice for pooled annuity funds. A pooled annuity fund constitutes an alternative way to protect against mortality risk compared to purchasing a life annuity. The crucial difference between the pooled annuity fund and purchase of a life annuity offered by an insurance company is that participants of a pooled annuity fund still have to bear some mortality risk while insured annuitants bear no mortality risk at all. The population of the pool is modelled by employing a Poisson process with time-dependent hazard-rate. It follows that the pool member's optimization problem has to account for the stochastic investment horizon and for jumps in wealth which occur if another pool member dies. In case the number of pool members goes to infinity analytical solutions are provided. For finite pool sizes the solution of the optimization problem is reduced to the numerical solution of a set of ODEs. A simulation and welfare analysis show that pooled annuity funds insure very effectively against longevity risk even if their pool size is rather small. Only very risk averse investors or those without access to small pools are more inclined to pay a risk premium to access private life annuity markets in order to lay off mortality risk completely. As even families constitute such small pools the model provides theoretical justification for the low empirical annuity demand. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This report responds to the objective in the Inquiry's Terms of Reference to best position Australia's financial system to meet Australia's evolving needs and support economic growth. It offers a blueprint for an efficient and resilient financial system over the next 10 to 20 years, characterised by the fair treatment of users. The Inquiry has made 44 recommendations relating to the Australian financial system. These recommendations reflect the Inquiry's judgement and are based on evidence received by the Inquiry. The Inquiry's test has been one of public interest: the interests of individuals, businesses, the economy, taxpayers and Government. Australia's financial system has performed well since the Wallis Inquiry and has many strong characteristics. It also has a number of weaknesses: taxation and regulatory settings distort the flow of funding to the real economy; it remains susceptible to financial shocks; superannuation is not delivering retirement incomes efficiently; unfair consumer outcomes remain prevalent; and policy settings do not focus on the benefits of competition and innovation. As a result, the system is prone to calls for more regulation. To put these issues in context, the Overview first deals with the characteristics of Australia's economy. It then describes the characteristics of and prerequisites for a well-functioning financial system and the Inquiry's philosophy of financial regulation. The Inquiry focuses on seven themes in this report (summarised in Guide to the Financial System Inquiry Final Report). The Overview deals with the general themes of funding the Australian economy and competition. The Inquiry has also made recommendations on five specific themes, which comprise the next chapters of this report: * Strengthen the economy by making the financial system more resilient. * Lift the value of the superannuation system and retirement incomes. * Drive economic growth and productivity through settings that promote innovation * Enhance confidence and trust by creating an environment in which financial firms treat customers fairly. * Enhance regulator independence and accountability, and minimise the need for future regulation. These recommendations seek to improve efficiency, resilience and fair treatment in the Australian financial system, allowing it to achieve its potential in supporting economic growth and enhancing standards of living for current and future generations.},

The study is based on longitudinal data recording marital status and socio-professional features at census times, therefore the observation scheme is interval-censored since individual characteristics are only observed at isolated dates and transition times remain unknown. To this aim, we develop a parametric maximum likelihood estimation procedure for multi-state models that takes into account both interval-censoring and reversible transitions. This method, inspired by recent advances in the statistical literature, allows us to capture characteristic-specific mortality rates, in particular to recover the mortality compensation law at high ages, but also to capture the age pattern of characteristics changes. The dynamics of several population compositions is addressed, and allows us to give explanations on the pattern of aggregate mortality, as well as on the impact on typical life insurance products. Particular attention is devoted to characteristic changes and parameter uncertainty that are both crucial to take into account.},

abstract = {Clustering is used by actuaries in a data compression process to make
massive or nested stochastic simulations practical to run. A large data
set of assets or liabilities is partitioned into a user-defined number
of clusters, each of which is compressed to a single representative
policy. The representative policies can then simulate the behavior of
the entire portfolio over a large range of stochastic scenarios. Such
processes are becoming increasingly important in understanding product
behavior and assessing reserving requirements in a big-data environment.
This article proposes a variety of clustering techniques that can be
used for this purpose. Initialization methods for performing clustering
compression are also compared, including principal components, factor
analysis, and segmentation. A variety of methods for choosing a
cluster's representative policy is considered. A real data set
comprising variable annuity policies, provided by Milliman, is used to
test the proposed methods. It is found that the compressed data sets
produced by the new methods, namely, model-based clustering, Ward's
minimum variance hierarchical clustering, and k-medoids clustering, can
replicate the behavior of the uncompressed (seriatim) data more
accurately than those obtained by the existing Milliman method. This is
verified within sample by examining location variable totals of the
representative policies versus the uncompressed data at the five levels
of compression of interest. More crucially it is also verified out of
sample by comparing the distributions of the present values of several
variables after 20 years across 1000 simulated scenarios based on the
compressed and seriatim data, using Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit
tests and weighted sums of squared differences.},

These papers state an erroneous self-financing condition.

In the second paper, this is equivalent to assuming that a subportfolio is self-financing on its own, rather than the whole portfolio. The error in the first paper is avoided when clearly distinguishing between price processes, dividend processes and gain processes. We present an outline of the derivation that yields the correct statement of the self-financing condition, clarifying the structure of the relevant funding accounts, and show that the final result in "Funding beyond discounting" is correct, even if the self-financing condition stated is not.},

abstract = {Introduction The homicide rates among young men in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are the highest in the world. It is not clear how this has impacted the life expectancy in these countries. This research has two purposes: (1) to quantify the impact of homicides on the mortality gap between LAC and high-income countries over recent years and (2) to assess the changes in homicide impact in overall survival over time. Methods Causes of death data were extracted for 23 countries in the LAC and 15 European countries (average European union-15 [EU-15]), using UN, UNODC, WHO, HMD and IHME databases for the period 2005-2014. The contribution by homicide deaths to the change in life expectancy, over time and as a difference between two populations, was quantified using decomposition methods. Results The contribution by homicide mortality to changes in life expectancy levels differed widely across the examined LAC countries. In Honduras, homicide mortality accounted for 1.75 (95{\%} CI 1.64 to 1.86) and 6.30 (95{\%} CI 6.07 to 6.53) years lower life expectancy than in the EU-15 countries for women and men, respectively. Contrary to this, homicide was just accountable for less than a couple of months of life expectancy differences between Chile and EU-15. Jamaica had the largest reduction in homicides and its impact increased life expectancy over time by almost half a year for men. However, Mexican men and Honduran women have experienced increases in mortality by homicide, which decreased their life expectancy by more than a quarter of a year between 2005 and 2014. Conclusions Excess mortality related to homicides in young people accounted for major changes in life expectancy in the LAC region. Furthermore, reducing excess mortality due to homicides is a crucial goal to further increase longevity towards levels of low-mortality countries. These reductions might prevent homicides spreading to other parts of Latin America. Decision and policy-makers in LAC need to address this immediately, and investing in the young population needs to be given a high priority.},

The study objective was to investigate the effect of neighbourhood deprivation with age, gender and socioeconomic status (SES) on (1) excess alcohol consumption and (2) binge drinking, in a representative population survey.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Cross-sectional study: multilevel analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: Wales, UK, adult population ∼2.2 million.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPARTICIPANTS: 58 282 respondents aged 18 years and over to four successive annual Welsh Health Surveys (2003/2004-2007), nested within 32 692 households, 1839 census lower super output areas and the 22 unitary authority areas in Wales.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Maximal daily alcohol consumption during the past week was categorised using the UK Department of Health definition of 'none/never drinks', 'within guidelines', 'excess consumption but less than binge' and 'binge'. The data were analysed using continuation ratio ordinal multilevel models with multiple imputation for missing covariates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Respondents in the most deprived neighbourhoods were more likely to binge drink than in the least deprived (adjusted estimates: 17.5{\%} vs 10.6{\%}; difference=6.9{\%}, 95{\%} CI 6.0 to 7.8), but were less likely to report excess consumption (17.6{\%} vs 21.3{\%}; difference=3.7{\%}, 95{\%} CI 2.6 to 4.8). The effect of deprivation varied significantly with age and gender, but not with SES. Younger men in deprived neighbourhoods were most likely to binge drink. Men aged 35-64 showed the steepest increase in binge drinking in deprived neighbourhoods, but men aged 18-24 showed a smaller increase with deprivation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This large-scale population study is the first to show that neighbourhood deprivation acts differentially on the risk of binge drinking between men and women at different age groups. Understanding the socioeconomic patterns of harmful alcohol consumption is important for public health policy development.},

abstract = {AbstractThis paper is concerned with dependency between business segments in the non-life insurance industry. When considering the business of an insurance company at the aggregate level, dependence structures can have a major impact in several areas of Enterprise Risk Management, such as in claims reserving and capital modelling. The accurate estimation of the diversification benefits related to the dependence structures between lines of business (LoBs) is crucial for (i) capital efficiency, as one should avoid holding unnecessarily high levels of capital, and (ii) solvency of the insurance company, as an underestimation, on the other hand, may lead to insufficient capitalisation and safety. There seems to be a great deal of preconception as to how dependent insurance claims should be. Often, presence of dependence is taken as a given and rarely discussed or challenged, perhaps because of the lack of extensive datasets to be publicly analysed. In this paper, we take a different approach, and consider how much correlation some real datasets actually display (the Meyers–Shi dataset from the USA, and the AUSI dataset from Australia). We develop a simple theoretical framework that enables us to explain how and why correlations can be illusory (and what we mean by that). We show with some real examples that, sometimes, most (if not all) of the correlation can be “explained” by an appropriate methodology. Two major conclusions stem from our analysis. 1.In any attempt to measure cross-LoB correlations, careful modelling of the data needs to be the order of the day. The exercise will not be well served by rough modelling, such as the use of simple chain ladders, and may indeed result in the prescription of excessive risk margins and/or capital margins.2.Such empirical evidence as examined in the paper reveals cross-LoB correlations that vary only in the range zero to very modest. There is little evidence in favour of the high correlation assumed in some jurisdictions. The evidence suggests that these assumptions derived from either poor modelling or a misconception of the cross-LoB dependencies relevant to the purpose to which they are applied.},

abstract = {Background: Mortality data at the population level are often aggregated in age classes, for example 5-year age groups with an open-ended interval for the elderly aged 85þ. Capturing detailed age-specific mortality patterns and mortality time trends from such coarsely grouped data can be problematic at older ages, especially where open-ended intervals are used. Methods: We illustrate the penalized composite link model (PCLM) for ungrouping to model cancer mortality surfaces. Smooth age-specific distributions from data grouped in age classes of adjacent calendar years were estimated by constructing a two-dimensional regression, based on B-splines, and maximizing a penalized likelihood. We show the applicability of the proposed model, analysing age-at-death distributions from cancers of all sites in Denmark from 1980 to 2014. Data were retrieved from the Danish Cancer Society and the Human Mortality Database. Results: The main trends captured by PCLM are: (i) a decrease in cancer mortality rates after the 1990s for ages 50-75; (ii) a decrease in cancer mortality in later cohorts for young ages, especially, and very advanced ages. Comparing the raw data by single year of age, with the PCLM-ungrouped distributions, we clearly illustrate that the model fits the data with a high level of accuracy. Conclusions: The PCLM produces detailed smooth mortality surfaces from death counts observed in coarse age groups with modest assumptions, that is Poisson distributed counts and smoothness of the estimated distribution. Hence, the method has great potential for use within epidemiological research when information is to be gained from aggregated data, because it avoids strict assumptions about the actual distributional shape.},

@article{DeBeer2016,
abstract = {Background: A decrease in mortality across all ages causes a shift of the age pattern of mortality, or mortality delay, while differences in the rate of decrease across ages cause a change in the shape of the age-at-death distribution, mortality compression or expansion. Evidence exists for both compression and delay of mortality. Existing parametric models to describe the full age pattern of mortality are not able to capture mortality delay versus mortality compression. More recent models that assess delay versus compression mostly focused on the adult or old ages alone and did not distinguish mortality compression below and above the modal age at death, although they represent different mechanisms. Methods: This paper presents a new parametric model that describes the full age pattern of mortality and assesses compression – at different stages of life – and delay of mortality: the CoDe model. The model includes 10 parameters, of which five are constant over time. The five time-varying parameters reflect delay of mortality and compression of mortality in infancy, adolescence, young adulthood, late adulthood, and old age. The model describes infant and background mortality by two simple functions, uses a mixed logistic model with different slopes in adult, middle, and old age, and includes the modal age at death as a parameter to account for the delay in mortality. Results: Applying the CoDe model to age-specific probabilities of death for Japanese, French, American, and Danish men and women between 1950 and 2010 showed a very good fit of the full age pattern of mortality. Delay of mortality explained about two-thirds of the increase in life expectancy at birth, whereas compression of mortality due to mortality declines in young age explained about one-third. No strong compression of mortality in late adulthood age was observed. Mortality compression in old age has had a small negative impact on life expectancy. Conclusions: The CoDe model proved a valid instrument for describing the full age pattern of mortality and for disentangling the effects of mortality delay and compression – at different stages of life – on the increase in life expectancy.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on shifts in the age distribution of homicide offending in the United States. This distribution remained remarkably stable with small but significant changes over a long period of time. Then between 1985 and 1990 the rates of homicide offending doubled for 15-to-19 year olds and increased nearly 40{\%} for 20-to-24 year olds, while the homicide offending rates decreased for those over 30. In addition to this ''epidemic of youth homicide,'' which lasted through the mid-1990s, there have been systematic changes in the age distribution of homicide in the United States associated with cohort replacement over the past 40 years. We introduce an estimable function approach for estimating the effects of age, period, and cohort. The method allows us to assess simultaneously the impacts of periods and cohorts on the age distribution of homicide offending. We find that although the age curve remains relatively stable, there are shifts in it associated systematically with cohort replacement. Cohort replacement accounts for nearly half of the upturn in youth homicides during the epidemic of youth homicides, but a significant fraction of that upturn is not associated with cohort replacement.

The algorithm estimates the effects of replacement for each elementary cell of one matrix by respective cell of another matrix. Application of the algorithm easily leads to the known formula for the age-decomposition of differences between two life expectancies. It also allows to develop new formulae for differences between healthy life expectancies. In the latter case, each age-component is split further into effects of mortality and effects of health. The application of the algorithm enables a numerical decomposition of the differences between total fertility rates and between parity progression ratios by age of the mother and parity. Empirical examples are based on mortality data from the USA, the UK, West Germany, and Poland and on fertility data from Russia.},

@article{Haugh2010a,
abstract = {One of the principal disadvantages of short rate models, and HJM models more generally, is that they focus on unobservable instantaneous interest rates. The so-called market models that were developed1 in the late 90's overcome this problem by directly modeling observable market rates such as LIBOR2 and swap rates. These models are straightforward to calibrate and have quickly gained widespread acceptance from practitioners. The first market models were actually developed in the HJM framework where the dynamics of instantaneous forward rates are used via Itˆ bond prices were then used, again via Itˆ o's Lemma to determine the dynamics of zero-coupon bonds. The dynamics of zero coupon o's Lemma, to determine the dynamics of LIBOR. Market models are therefore not inconsistent with HJM models. In these lecture notes, however, we will prefer to specify the market models directly rather than derive them in the HJM framework. In the process, we will derive Black's formulae for caplets and swaptions thereby demonstrating the consistency of these formulae with martingale pricing theory. Throughout these notes, we will ignore the possibility of default or counter-party risk and treat LIBOR interest rates as the fundamental rates in the market. Zero-coupon bond prices are then computed using LIBOR rather than the default-free rates implied by the prices of government securities. This does result in a minor inconsistency in that we price derivative securities assuming no possibility of default yet the interest rates themselves that play the role of “underlying security”, i.e. LIBOR and swap rates, implicitly incorporate the possibility of default. This inconsistency actually occurs in practice when banks trade caps, swaps and other instruments with each other, and ignore the possibility of default when quoting prices. Instead, the associated credit risks are kept to a minimum through the use of netting agreements and by counter-parties limiting the total size of trades they conduct with one another. This approach can also be justified when counter-parties have a similar credit rating and similar exposures to one another. Finally, we should mention that it is indeed possible3, and sometimes necessary, to explicitly model credit risk even when we are pricing ‘standard' securities such as caps and swaps. It goes without saying of course, that default risk needs to be modeled explicitly when pricing credit derivatives and related securities. Spring 2010},

abstract = {AIM: The aim of this study was to obtain information regarding the incidence of cellulitis or cutaneous abscess in children of Polynesian ethnicity (including New Zealand Maori), and to calculate the relative risk increase versus other ethnicities. METHODS: We reviewed all patients aged between 1 to 14 years who were admitted at our tertiary care institution during the year 2000. Ninety-one children (of 10 different ethnicities) with skin infections were identified. RESULTS: The most common diagnosis was cutaneous abscess (46 of 91 cases, 50.5{\%}), followed by cellulitis (45 of 91 cases, 49.5{\%}). The most common location of infection was the lower limb (79.1{\%}). The major pathogenic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. All but one of the children had an uneventful recovery. The incidence of infection in the Polynesian children was 137.7 per 100,000, and the incidence in European children (and children of other ethnic groups) was 35.4 per 100,000. In addition, we calculated a relative risk increase of 3.89 (95{\%} confidence interval of 2.33 to 6.52, p {\textless}0.05), which underlines the increased risk that Polynesian children suffer from skin infection. CONCLUSION: This is the first study showing (in detail) how Polynesian children are affected by a high incidence and increased relative risk of skin infections in their limbs (arms and legs). However, further research (to identify whether genetic disposition or social and environmental circumstances are involved) is required.},

Recent approaches consider a coherent or expectation bounded risk measure and minimize the global risk of the ceding company under adequate constraints. However, there is no consensus about the risk measure that the insurer must use, since every risk measure presents advantages and shortcomings when compared with others. This paper deals with a discrete probability space and analyzes the stability of the optimal reinsurance with respect to the risk measure that the insurer uses. We will demonstrate that there is a "stable optimal retention" that will show no sensitivity, insofar as it will solve the optimal reinsurance problem for many risk measures, thus providing a very robust reinsurance plan. This stable optimal retention is a stop-loss contract, and it is easy to compute in practice. A fast linear time algorithm will be given and a numerical example presented. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated trends in lifespan variation over four decades (1971-2010) by occupational social class (manual, lower nonmanual, upper nonmanual, other) using Finnish register data. We performed age and cause-of-death decompositions of lifespan variation for each sex (a) by occupational class over time and (b) between occupational classes at a shared level of life expectancy. Although life expectancy increased in all classes, lifespan variation was stable among manual workers and decreased only among nonmanual classes. These differences were caused by early-adult mortality: older-age lifespan variation declined for all the classes, but variation in early-adult mortality increased for all classes except the highest. The manual class's high and stagnant lifespan variation was driven by declines in circulatory diseases that were equally spread over early mortality-compressing and older mortality-expanding ages, as well as by high early-adult mortality from external causes. Results were similar for men and women. The results of this study, which is the first to document trends in lifespan variation by social class, suggest that mortality compression is compatible with increasing life expectancy but currently achieved only by higher occupational classes.},

We demonstrate the use of this model life table system to extrapolate full age patterns of mortality from age-restricted mortality indicators such as 5q0 or 45q15. We conduct an out-of-sample validation using life tables from both the Human Mortality Database and the WHO life table database (World Health Organization, 2010). A friendly R package that implements the model life table system calibrated to the Human Mortality Database life tables is available by request.},

abstract = {Variable annuity (VA) with embedded guarantees have rapidly grown in popularity around the world in recent years. Valuation of VAs has been studied extensively in past decades. However, most of the studies focus on a single contract. These methods can be extended neither to valuate nor to manage the risk of a large variable annuity portfolio due to the computational complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient moment matching machine learning method to solve this problem. This method is proved to be a good candidate for risk management in terms of the speed of and the complexity of computing the annual dollar deltas, VaRs and CVaRs for a large variable annuity portfolio whose contracts are over a period of 25 years. There are two stages for our method. First, we select a small number of contracts and propose a moment matching Monte Carlo method based on the Johnson curve, rather than the well known nested simulations, to compute the annual dollar deltas, VaRs and CVaRs for each selected contract. Then, these computed results are used as a training set for well known machine learning methods, such as regression tree, neural network and so on. Afterwards, the annual dollar deltas, VaRs and CVaRs for the entire portfolio are predicted through the trained machine learning method. Compared to other existing methods Bauer et al. (2008); Gan (2013); Gan and Lin (2015), our method is very efficient and accurate. Finally, our test results support our claims.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, World Health Organization. All rights reserved. Objective To investigate a new approach to calculating cause-related standardized mortality rates that involves assigning weights to each cause of death reported on death certificates. Methods We derived cause-related standardized mortality rates from death certificate data for France in 2010 using: (i) the classic method, which considered only the underlying cause of death; and (ii) three novel multiple-cause-of-death weighting methods, which assigned weights to multiple causes of death mentioned on death certificates: the first two multiple-cause-of-death methods assigned non-zero weights to all causes mentioned and the third assigned non-zero weights to only the underlying cause and other contributing causes that were not part of the main morbid process. As the sum of the weights for each death certificate was 1, each death had an equal influence on mortality estimates and the total number of deaths was unchanged. Mortality rates derived using the different methods were compared. Findings On average, 3.4 causes per death were listed on each certificate. The standardized mortality rate calculated using the third multiple-cause-of-death weighting method was more than 20{\%} higher than that calculated using the classic method for five disease categories: skin diseases, mental disorders, endocrine and nutritional diseases, blood diseases and genitourinary diseases. Moreover, this method highlighted the mortality burden associated with certain diseases in specific age groups. Conclusion A multiple-cause-of-death weighting approach to calculating cause-related standardized mortality rates from death certificate data identified conditions that contributed more to mortality than indicated by the classic method. This new approach holds promise for identifying underrecognized contributors to mortality.},

The selected data set may exist information redundancy. On that account, this study proposes an alternative approach to screen out proper input and output variables set for evaluation via Akaike's information criteria (AIC) rule. This method mainly focuses on assessing the importance of subset of original variables rather than testing the marginal role of variables one by one in many other methods. In terms of the proposed approach, the most optimized variable set contains the least redundant information, which provides decision support to the decision makers. Besides, we also define redundant/cross redundant variables with the form of theorems and give the proofs subsequently. In addition, the AIC approach is firstly extended to stochastic data set to select an appropriate set of stochastic variables as well. Finally, the proposed approach has been applied to some data sets from given data and prior DEA literatures.},

The model adopts a convergence structure from “initial” to “long-term” rates of mortality improvement as the process of projection. The initial rates of mortality improvement are derived using two-dimensional P-spline methodology. Given the short history of Chinese data, the long-term rates of mortality improvement are determined by borrowing information from international experience. K-means clustering with dynamic time warping distance is used to classify populations, which is novel in the actuarial mortality research field. The original CMI approach is deterministic, however, in this paper we make it stochastic using techniques outlined by Koller and described by Browne {\textless}italic{\textgreater}et al{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} .

Instead of the commonly used factor-based decomposition framework, we consider modeling mortality improvements using a random field specification with a given causal structure. Such a class of models introduces dependencies among adjacent cohorts aiming at capturing, among others, the cohort effects and cross generations correlations. It also describes the conditional heteroskedasticity of mortality. The proposed model is a generalization of the now widely used AR-ARCH models for random processes. For such a class of models, we propose an estimation procedure for the parameters. Formally, we use the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) and show its statistical consistency and the asymptotic normality of the estimated parameters. The framework being general, we investigate and illustrate a simple variant, called the three-level memory model, in order to fully understand and assess the effectiveness of the approach for modeling mortality dynamics.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of valuating and hedging life insurance contracts that are subject to systematic mortality risk in the sense that the mortality intensity of all policy-holders is affected by some underlying stochastic processes. In particular, this implies that the insurance risk cannot be eliminated by increasing the size of the portfolio and appealing to the law of large numbers. We propose to apply techniques from incomplete markets in order to hedge and valuate these contracts. We consider a special case of the affine mortality structures considered by Dahl [Dahl, M., 2004. Stochastic mortality in life insurance: market reserves and mortality-linked insurance contracts. Insurance Math. Econom. 35, 113-136], where the underlying mortality process is driven by a time-inhomogeneous Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model. Within this model, we study a general set of equivalent martingale measures, and determine market reserves by applying these measures. In addition, we derive risk-minimizing strategies and mean-variance indifference prices and hedging strategies for the life insurance liabilities considered. Numerical examples are included, and the use of the stochastic mortality model is compared with deterministic models. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper examines household decisions about whether or not to annuitize retirement resources. A life-cycle model of consumption, implemented with the use of dynamic programming techniques, is used to construct a utility-based measure of annuity value for individuals and couples in the Health and Retirement Survey. Variation in the calculated 'annuity equivalent wealth' arises from differences in mortality risk, marital status, risk aversion, and the presence of pre-existing annuities such as Social Security. I find that a one-percentage point increase in the annuity equivalent wealth leads to nearly a one-percentage point increase in the ex ante probability of annuitizing balances in defined contribution pension plans. However, because much of the variation in the expected annuity decision is left unexplained by the life-cycle model, other factors are also analyzed. Health status and an individual's time horizon for financial decision making are significant determinants of the decision. There is no evidence that bequest motives are an important factor in making marginal annuity decisions. {\textcopyright} Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {We introduce the general arbitrage-free valuation framework for counterparty risk adjustments in presence of bilateral default risk, including default of the investor. We illustrate the symmetry in the valuation and show that the adjustment involves a long position in a put option plus a short position in a call option, both with zero strike and written on the residual net value of the contract at the relevant default times. We allow for correlation between the default times of the investor, counterparty and underlying portfolio risk factors. We use arbitrage-free stochastic dynamical models. We then specialize our analysis to Credit Default Swaps (CDS) as underlying portfolio, generalizing the work of Brigo and Chourdakis (2008) [5] who deal with unilateral and asymmetric counterparty risk. We introduce stochastic intensity models and a trivariate copula function on the default times exponential variables to model default dependence. Similarly to [5], we find that both default correlation and credit spread volatilities have a relevant and structured impact on the adjustment. Differently from [5], the two parties will now agree on the credit valuation adjustment. We study a case involving British Airways, Lehman Brothers and Royal Dutch Shell, illustrating the bilateral adjustments in concrete crisis situations.},

abstract = {Age-specific mortality rates are often disaggregated by different attributes, such as sex, state, ethnic group and socioeconomic status. In making social policies and pricing annuity at national and subnational levels, it is important not only to forecast mortality accurately, but also to ensure that forecasts at the subnational level add up to the forecasts at the national level. This motivates recent developments in grouped functional time series methods (Shang and Hyndman, in press) to reconcile age-specific mortality forecasts. We extend these grouped functional time series forecasting methods to multivariate time series, and apply them to produce point forecasts of mortality rates at older ages, from which fixed-term annuities for different ages and maturities can be priced. Using the regional age-specific mortality rates in Japan obtained from the Japanese Mortality Database, we investigate the one-step-ahead to 15-step-ahead point-forecast accuracy between the independent and grouped forecasting methods. The grouped forecasting methods are shown not only to be useful for reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates at national and subnational levels, but they are also shown to allow improved forecast accuracy. The improved forecast accuracy of mortality rates is of great interest to the insurance and pension industries for estimating annuity prices, in particular at the level of population subgroups, defined by key factors such as sex, region, and socioeconomic grouping.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Two processes generate total variance in age at death: heterogeneity (between-group variance) and individual stochasticity (within-group variance). Limited research has evaluated how these two components have changed over time. We quantify the degree to which area-level deprivation contributed to total variance in age at death in Scotland between 1981 and 2011. DESIGN Full population and mortality data for Scotland were obtained and matched with the Carstairs score, a standardised z-score calculated for each part-postcode sector that measures relative area-level deprivation. A z-score above zero indicates that the part-postcode sector experienced higher deprivation than the national average. A z-score below zero indicates lower deprivation. From the aggregated data we constructed 40 lifetables, one for each deprivation quintile in 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011 stratified by sex. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES Total variance in age at death and the proportion explained by area-level deprivation heterogeneity (between-group variance). RESULTS The most deprived areas experienced stagnating or slightly increasing variance in age at death. The least deprived areas experienced decreasing variance. For males, the most deprived quintile life expectancy was between 7{\%} and 11{\%} lower and the SD is between 6{\%} and 25{\%} higher than the least deprived. This suggests that the effect of deprivation on the SD of longevity is comparable to its effect on life expectancy. Decomposition analysis revealed that contributions from between-group variance doubled between 1981 and 2011 but at most only explained 4{\%} of total variance. CONCLUSIONS This study adds to the emerging body of literature demonstrating that socio-economic groups have experienced diverging trends in variance in age at death. The contribution from area-level deprivation to total variance in age at death, which we were able to capture, has doubled since 1981. Area-level deprivation may play an increasingly important role in mortality inequalities.},

In the area of public policy, they help policymakers and analysts assess how much various groups benefit from public programs, such as social security and health care. In financial markets and especially for actuaries, they are important for designing annuities and life insurance products. This paper presents a method for clustering information about differential mortality by country. The approach is then used to group mortality surfaces for European Union (EU) countries. The aim of this paper is to measure between-group inequality in mortality experience in EU countries through a range of mortality indicators. Additionally, the indicators permit the characterization of each group. It is important to take into account characteristics such as sex; therefore, this study differentiates between males and females in order to detect whether their patterns and characterizations are different. It is concluded that there are clear differences in mortality between the east and west of the EU that are more important than the traditional south–north division, with a significant disadvantage for Eastern Europe, and especially for males in Baltic countries. We find that the mortality indicators have evolved in all countries in such a way that the gap between groups has been maintained, both in terms of the differences in mortality levels and variability.},

@article{Bell2020,
abstract = {Context: Age, period and birth cohort (APC) effects have been known for decades in biological, health and social sciences. However, exact collinearity between these three (Age = Year-Birth Year) leads to difficulty estimating these effects. It is thus impossible to estimate linear components of these effects without strong assumptions about at least one of these. This is problematic for anyone interested in APC patterns. Attempts to 'solve' this identification problem without strong assumptions are, in fact, making hidden unintended assumptions. Objective: Provide an overview of what APC effects are and the nature of the identification problem, before reviewing and critiquing methodological literature across the health and social sciences. I also present an argument for what researchers should do. Method: non-systematic review of methodological literature across health and social sciences. Results: Recommendations include considering non-linearities around linear APC effects, and stating strong and explicit theory-based assumptions. Mechanical solutions to the identification problem do not work. Conclusion: These recommendations acknowledge there is a 'line of solutions' of possible combinations of APC effects, and not a single answer that can be estimated empirically. None of these methods solve the identification problem-rather they acknowledgement that methods are limited by assumptions.},

abstract = {Age-period-cohort (APC) models are widely used for studying time trends of disease incidence or mortality. Model identifiability has become less of a problem with Bayesian APC models. These models are usually based on random walk (RW1, RW2) smoothing priors. For long and complex time series and for long predicted periods, these models as such may not be adequate. We present two extensions for the APC models. First, we introduce flexible interactions between the age, period and cohort effects based on a two-dimensional conditional autoregressive smoothing prior on the age/period plane. Our second extension uses autoregressive integrated (ARI) models to provide reasonable long-term predictions. To illustrate the utility of our model framework, we provide stochastic predictions for the Finnish male and female population, in 2010-2050. For that, we first study and forecast all-cause male and female mortality in Finland, 1878-2050, showing that using an interaction term is needed for fitting and interpreting the observed data. We then provide population predictions using a cohort component model, which also requires predictions for fertility and migration. As our main conclusion, ARI models have better properties for predictions than the simple RW models do, but mixing these prediction models with RW1 or RW2 smoothing priors for observed periods leads to a model that is not fully consistent. Further research with our model framework will concentrate on using a more consistent model for smoothing and prediction, such as autoregressive integrated moving average models with state-space methods or Gaussian process priors.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A deep-deferred annuity is a deferred annuity where payments start very late in life, i.e. well after the normal retirement age. This annuity has received much attention lately as it was made accessible to 401(k) plans in the United States in 2014. By transferring the risk of outliving retirement savings at high ages to annuity providers, deep-deferred annuities provide annuitants with enhanced later-life financial security. However, the valuation of this annuity suffers from high uncertainty because the mortality data at high ages are sparse and possibly unreliable. In this paper, we use risk ratio to measure demographic risk in the valuation. Demographic risk is decomposed into the following four components: (1) mortality tail curve risk, (2) mortality improvement model risk, (3) parameter risk in mortality tail curves, and (4) parameter risk in mortality improvement rate models. Our quantitative analysis aims to provide insights into the development and risk management of deep-deferred annuities.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Compression of mortality is measured here in four ways: 1) by standard deviation of the age at death above the mode; 2) by standard deviation of the age at death in the highest quartile; 3) by the inter-quartile range; and 4) by the shortest age interval in which a given proportion of deaths take place. The two first-mentioned are directed at old ages, while the other two measure compression over the entire age range. The fourth alternative is recommended as the most suitable for general use and offers several variations, called the C-family of compression indicators. Applied to historical and modern populations, all four measures show convincingly that the secular transition from high to low mortality has been accompanied by general and massive compression of mortality. In recent decades, however, this development has come close to stagnation even when life expectancy continues to increase. This has happened at a level where compression is still so incomplete that the shortest age interval in which 90{\%} of deaths occur, is 35 years. It seems unrealistic to expect human mortality ever to be compressed into so narrow an age interval that the survival curve would even approximately rectangular. It is considered useful to monitor changes in the compression of mortality because the indicators describe relevant aspects of the length of life and may acquire new significance as indicators of population heterogeneity.},

abstract = {The classical problem of identifying the optimal risk transfer from one insurance company to multiple reinsurance companies is examined under some quantile-based risk measure criteria. We develop a new methodology via a two-stage optimisation procedure which not only allows us to recover some existing results in the literature, but also makes possible the analysis of high-dimensional problems in which the insurance company diversifies its risk with multiple reinsurance counter-parties, where the insurer risk position and the premium charged by the reinsurers are functions of the underlying risk quantile. Closed-form solutions are elaborated for some particular settings, although numerical methods for the second part of our procedure represent viable alternatives for the ease of implementing it in more complex scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss some approaches to obtain more robust results. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Li2017a,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper proposes a spatial-temporal autoregressive model for the mortality surface, where mortality rates of each age depend on the historical values of itself (temporality) and the neighbouring ages (spatiality). The mortality dynamics is formulated as a large, first order vector autoregressive model which encompasses standard factor models such as the Lee and Carter (1992) model. Sparsity and smoothness constraints are then introduced, based on the idea that the nearer the two ages, the more important the dependence between mortalities at these ages. Our model has several novelties. First, it ensures that in the long-run, mortality rates at different ages do not diverge. Second, it provides a natural explanation of the so-called cohort effect without identifiability difficulties. Third, the model is easily extended to the multiple-population case in a coherent way. Finally, the model is associated with a closed form, non-parametric estimation method: the penalized least square, which ensures spatial smoothness of the age-dependent parameters. Using US and UK mortality data, we find that our model produces reasonable projected mortality profile in the long-run, as well as satisfying short-run out-of-sample forecast performance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Merton1976,
abstract = {The validity of the classic Black-Scholes option pricing formula depends on the capability of investors to follow a dynamic portfolio strategy in the stock that replicates the payoff structure to the option. The critical assumption required for such a strategy to be feasible, is that the underlying stock return dynamics can be described by a stochastic process with a continuous sample path. In this paper, an option pricing formula is derived for the more-general case when the underlying stock returns are generated by a mixture of both continuous and jump processes. The derived formula has most of the attractive features of the original Black-Scholes formula in that it does not depend on investor preferences or knowledge of the expected return on the underlying stock. Moreover, the same analysis applied to the options can be extended to the pricing of corporate liabilities. ?? 1976.},

abstract = {Objectives This study describes key population health concepts and examines major empirical trends in US health and healthcare inequalities from 1935 to 2016 according to important social determinants such as race/ethnicity, education, income, poverty, area deprivation, unemployment, housing, rural-urban residence, and geographic location. Methods Long-term trend data from the National Vital Statistics System, National Health Interview Survey, National Survey of Children's Health, American Community Survey, and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used to examine racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, rural-urban, and geographic inequalities in health and health care. Life tables, age-adjusted rates, prevalence, and risk ratios were used to examine health differentials, which were tested for statistical significance at the 0.05 level. Results Life expectancy of Americans increased from 69.7 years in 1950 to 78.8 years in 2015. However, despite the overall improvement, substantial gender and racial/ethnic disparities remained. In 2015, life expectancy was highest for Asian/Pacific Islanders (87.7 years) and lowest for African-Americans (75.7 years). Life expectancy was lower in rural areas and varied from 74.5 years for men in rural areas to 82.4 years for women in large metro areas, with rural-urban disparities increasing during the 1990-2014 time period. Infant mortality rates declined dramatically during the past eight decades. However, racial disparities widened over time; in 2015, black infants had 2.3 times higher mortality than white infants (11.4 vs. 4.9 per 1,000 live births). Infant and child mortality was markedly higher in rural areas and poor communities. Black infants and children in poor, rural communities had nearly three times higher mortality rate compared to those in affluent, rural areas. Racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities were particularly marked in mortality and/or morbidity from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, COPD, HIV/AIDS, homicide, psychological distress, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and access to quality health care. Conclusions and Global Health Implications Despite the overall health improvement, significant social disparities remain in a number of health indicators, most notably in life expectancy and infant mortality. Marked disparities in various health outcomes indicate the underlying significance of social determinants in disease prevention and health promotion and necessitate systematic and continued monitoring of health inequalities according to social factors. A multi-sectoral approach is needed to tackle persistent and widening health inequalities among Americans.},

abstract = {Central and Eastern Europe have experienced considerable instability in mortality since the 1960s. Long periods of stagnating life expectancy were followed by rapid increases in life expectancy and in some cases even more rapid declines before more recent periods of improvement. These trends have been well documented but to date, no study has comprehensively explored trends in lifespan variation. We improve such analyses by incorporating life disparity as a health indicator alongside life expectancy. We analyzed how lifespan variation has changed since the 1960s for 12 countries from the region and determined the ages which have contributed the most to the observed variability in age at death. Furthermore, we quanti ed the e ect of mortality related to alcohol consumption on life disparity since 1994. Our results showed that life disparity was high and strongly uctuating over the time period. Life expectancy and life disparity moved independently from one another, particularly during periods of life expectancy stagnation. Fluctuations in mortality were, to a large extent, directly or partially attributable to changes in alcohol consumption. These trends run counter to the common patterns observed in most developed countries and contribute to the life expectancy-disparity discussion by showing that expansion/compression levels do not necessarily mean lower/higher life expectancy or mortality deterioration/improvements.},

Compared with a uniform delay, some argue that those who have entered precociously the labor market should be allowed to retire earlier. They assert that such a ‘long career' exception is all the more justified that those unskilled workers live also less long due to heavier and potentially health-damaging jobs. In this paper, we then study macroeconomic and distributional consequences of global gain in life expectancy, with or without the postponement of the legal age of retirement and with or without a ‘long career' exception. By considering a framework where individuals decide to acquire skills depending on economic incentives and differential mortality, we focus particularly on spillover effects possibly generated by education. We show in particular that introducing a ‘long career' exception cannot be to the advantage of future unskilled workers unless education yields no spillover effects.},

abstract = {Increases in longevity and decreases in fertility have led to the aging of many countries' populations and to increases in old-age dependency ratios, the number of those over age 65 to the number of workers (usually expressed as those between ages 15 and 65). At the same time, current interest rates in many countries are at very low levels. These developments have increased concerns about the economic sustainability of current social security programs, resulting in pressure to modify their structure through reduced benefits and / or increased contributions, and in particular through an increase in their eligibility age (the age when an individual is eligible according to program rules to begin receiving full retirement benefits) that is the subject of this report. Simultaneously, these trends have increased pressure to contain the cost and manage uncertainty associated with defined benefit employer-sponsored pension plans, and created concerns regarding the ability of defined contribution plans to provide adequate retirement income. Among alternatives considered in response to concerns about sustainability or affordability, many countries have increased or are considering increasing their eligibility age rather than reducing benefits or increasing contributions, both of which are usually deemed undesirable. This has usually been accompanied by an increase in the average age of retirement (i.e., when an individual chooses to leave the labour force).},

abstract = {Background: Recent research has suggested that increases in mortality among middle-aged US Whites are being driven by suicides and poisonings from alcohol and drug use. Increases in these ‘despair' deaths have been argued to reflect a cohort-based epidemic of pain and distress among middle-aged US Whites. Methods: We examine trends in all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates among younger and middle-aged US White men and women between 1980 and 2014, using official US mortality data. We estimate trends in cause-specific mortality from suicides, alcohol-related deaths, drug-related deaths, ‘metabolic diseases' (i.e. deaths from heart diseases, diabetes, obesity and/or hypertension), and residual deaths from extrinsic causes (i.e. causes external to the body). We examine variation in mortality trends by gender, age and cause of death, and decompose trends into period- and cohort-based variation. Results: Trends in middle-aged US White mortality vary considerably by cause and gender. The relative contribution to overall mortality rates from drug-related deaths has increased dramatically since the early 1990s, but the contributions from suicide and alcohol-related deaths have remained stable. Rising mortality from drug-related deaths exhibit strong period-based patterns. Declines in deaths from metabolic diseases have slowed for middle-aged White men and have stalled for middle-aged White women, and exhibit strong cohort-based patterns. Conclusions: We find little empirical support for the pain- and distress-based explanations for rising mortality in the US White population. Instead, recent mortality increases among younger and middle-aged US White men and women have likely been shaped by the US opiate epidemic and an expanding obesogenic environment.},

abstract = {The vast literature on extrapolative stochastic mortality models focuses mainly on the extrapolation of past mortality trends and summarizes the trends by one or more latent factors. However, the interpretation of these trends is typically not very clear. On the other hand, explanation methods are trying to link mortality dynamics with observable factors. This serves as an intermediate step between the two methods. We perform a comprehensive analysis on the relationship between the latent trend in mortality dynamics and the trend in economic growth represented by gross domestic product (GDP). Subsequently, the Lee-Carter framework is extended through the introduction of GDP as an additional factor next to the latent factor, which provides a better fit and better interpretable forecasts.},

@article{Marang-vandeMheen1998a,
abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the size of mortality differentials in men by social class in Scotland as compared with England and Wales, and to analyse the time trends in these differentials. SUBJECTS: Men from England and Wales and Scotland around each census from 1951 to 1981. METHODS: Poisson regression analysis was used to calculate relative indices of inequality for disease specific and all cause mortality as a measure of mortality differentials between social classes. This measure is not dependent on the size of the social class groups, so it can be used to compare the magnitude of differentials over time periods during which the relative sizes of social class groups change. MAIN RESULTS: While overall death rates were higher in Scotland than in England and Wales around the 1951, 1961, and 1971 censuses the relative indices of inequality indicated smaller mortality differences between social classes in Scotland. Inequality, as indexed by the relative index of inequality, increased over time in both Scotland and England and Wales, but to a greater degree in Scotland, resulting in greater social class mortality differentials for Scotland in 1981 (the relative index of inequality increased from 1.40 to 2.43 for England and Wales, and from 1.22 to 2.57 for Scotland between 1951 and 1981). This greater increase in the magnitude of inequalities in all cause mortality in Scotland seemed to result from increasing social class differentials in cardiovascular disease, accidents and external causes, and "all other causes of death". Examining the trends in overall death rates, it seems that the greater increase in social class differences in Scotland occurred because of the greater decrease in death rates among the privileged social groups, in combination with a smaller decrease (or a greater increase) in the death rates in the lower social class groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that trends in mortality and in inequalities in mortality differ within Great Britain. Although death rates were higher in Scotland than in England and Wales, smaller mortality differentials by social class were found in Scotland over the period 1951 to 1971. By 1981, however, social class mortality differentials were greater in Scotland than in England and Wales. The greater increase in the social class differentials over time in Scotland, may have contributed to the worsening overall mortality profile in Scotland as compared with England and Wales that occurred between 1971 and 1981.},

The Feynman-Kac theorem provides a PDE model for the spread option pricing problem which is initially posed in an unbounded domain. After a localization procedure and the consideration of appropriate boundary conditions in a bounded domain, we propose a Crank-Nicholson characteristic time discretization scheme combined with a Lagrange piecewise quadratic finite element for the spatial discretization.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Monitoring the time course of socio-economic inequalities in mortality is a key public health issue. The aim of this study is to analyse this trend at an ecological level, in mainland France, over the 1990s, using a deprivation index enabling time comparisons. METHODS: Deprivation indexes (FDep) were built using the 1990 and 1999 data and the same methodology. The indices were defined as the first component of a principal component analysis including four specific socio-economic variables. The time course of the association between mortality and deprivation was evaluated on the 'commune' geographic scale (36 000 U in mainland France), without considering spatial autocorrelation and on the larger 'canton' scale (3700 U), considering spatial autocorrelation. The analysis was carried out by gender, age and degree of urbanicity and applied to general mortality and a specific subcategory: 'avoidable' deaths. RESULTS: Area-level socio-economic inequalities in mortality tended to increase during the 1990s. For the period 1997-2001, the standard mortality ratio (SMR) was 24{\%} higher for the communes in the most deprived quintile than for those in the least deprived quintile, while this differential was of 20{\%} for the period 1988-92. This increase in the differentials concerned especially males and people in the age group of {\textless}65 years. For both men and women, it was stronger for the 'avoidable' mortality subcategory. CONCLUSION: As observed at the individual level in previous studies, area-level socio-economic inequalities in health increased during the nineties, while general health improved.},

@article{Verdonck2011,
abstract = {The chain-ladder method is a widely used technique to forecast the reserves that have to be kept regarding claims that are known to exist, but for which the actual size is unknown at the time the reserves have to be set. In practice it can be easily seen that even one outlier can lead to a huge over- or underestimation of the overall reserve when using the chain-ladder method. This indicates that individual claims can be very influential when determining the chain-ladder estimates. In this paper the effect of contamination is mathematically analyzed by calculating influence functions in the generalized linear model framework corresponding to the chain-ladder method. It is proven that the influence functions are unbounded, confirming the sensitivity of the chain-ladder method to outliers. A robust alternative is introduced to estimate the generalized linear model parameters in a more outlier resistant way. Finally, based on the influence functions and the robust estimators, a diagnostic tool is presented highlighting the influence of every individual claim on the classical chain-ladder estimates. With this tool it is possible to detect immediately which claims have an abnormally positive or negative influence on the reserve estimates. Further examination of these influential points is then advisable. A study of artificial and real run-off triangles shows the good performance of the robust chain-ladder method and the diagnostic tool. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This report presents preliminary results describing the effects of implementing the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) on mortality statistics for selected causes of death effective with deaths occurring in the United States in 1999. The report also describes major features of the Tenth Revision (ICD-10), including changes from the Ninth Revision (ICD-9) in classification and rules for selecting underlying causes of death. Application of comparability ratios is also discussed. METHODS: The report is based on cause-of-death information from a large sample of 1996 death certificates filed in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Cause-of-death information in the sample includes underlying cause of death classified by both ICD-9 and ICD-10. Because the data file on which comparability information is derived is incomplete, results are preliminary. RESULTS: Preliminary comparability ratios by cause of death presented in this report indicate the extent of discontinuities in cause-of-death trends from 1998 through 1999 resulting from implementing ICD-10. For some leading causes (e.g., Septicemia, Influenza and pneumonia, Alzheimer's disease, and Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis), the discontinuity in trend is substantial. The ranking of leading causes of death is also substantially affected for some causes of death. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study, although preliminary, are essential to analyzing trends in mortality between ICD-9 and ICD-10. In particular, the results provide a means for interpreting changes between 1998, which is the last year in which ICD-9 was used, and 1999, the year in which ICD-10 was implemented for mortality in the United States.},

abstract = {We propose the use of statistical emulators for the purpose of analyzing mortality-linked contracts in stochastic mortality models. Such models typically require (nested) evaluation of expected values of nonlinear functionals of multi-dimensional stochastic processes. Except in the simplest cases, no closed-form expressions are available, necessitating numerical approximation. To complement various analytic approximations, we advocate the use of modern statistical tools from machine learning to generate a flexible, non-parametric surrogate for the true mappings. This method allows performance guarantees regarding approximation accuracy and removes the need for nested simulation. We illustrate our approach with case studies involving (i) a Lee-Carter model with mortality shocks; (ii) index-based static hedging with longevity basis risk; (iii) a Cairns-Blake-Dowd stochastic survival probability model; (iv) variable annuities under stochastic interest rate and mortality.},

More specifically, a modified version of the normal constraint method is implemented with a global solver in order to generate a dotted approximation of the Pareto frontier for bi- and tri-objective programming problems. Numerical experiments are carried out on a set of portfolios to be optimized for an EU-based non-life insurance company. Both performance indicators and risk measures are managed as objectives. Results show that this procedure is effective and readily applicable to achieve suitable risk-reward tradeoff analysis.},

They also give rise to consideration of strategies at the individual and societal level for recog- nizing and addressing changing technologies in all segments of the labor market. The challenges have always been great and will continue to be so. The current issues reflect an ongoing evolution. Hence, to do what we do within the area of pensions best, we need to bring together the worlds of policy and academia and to familiarize ourselves with, understand, and weigh how new knowledge gained from the experience of others and developments in research can help move our own and other countries forward. This was the overriding theme of the Rome conference and is the overriding theme of this third NDC anthology. We are pleased to have had the opportunity to share the respon- sibility for this undertaking with our Italian cosponsor and are grateful for the buy-in of the World Bank in this project.},

This implies the study of the claims reserving problem for a portfolio consisting of several correlated run-off triangles. A popular technique to deal with such a portfolio is the multivariate chain-ladder method of Merz and W??thrich (2008). However, it is well known that the chain-ladder method is very sensitive to outlying data. For the univariate case, we have already developed a robust version of the chain-ladder method. In this article we propose two techniques to detect and correct outlying values in a bivariate situation.

abstract = {Age-at-death distributions provide an informative description of the mortality pattern of a population but have generally been neglected for modelling and forecasting mortality. In this paper, we use the distribution of deaths to model and forecast adult mortality. Specifically, we introduce a relational model that relates a fixed ‘standard' to a series of observed distributions by a transformation of the age axis. The proposed Segmented Transformation Age-at-death Distributions (STAD) model is parsimonious and efficient: using only three parameters, it captures and disentangles mortality developments in terms of shifting and compression dynamics. Additionally, mortality forecasts can be derived from parameter extrapolation using time-series models. We illustrate our method and compare it with the Lee–Carter model and variants for females in four high-longevity countries. We show that the STAD fits the observed mortality pattern very well, and that its forecasts are more accurate and optimistic than the Lee–Carter variants.},

abstract = {Age-specific mortality rates are often disaggregated by different attributes, such as sex, state and ethnicity. Forecasting age-specific mortality rates at the national and sub-national levels plays an important role in developing social policy. However, independent forecasts at the sub-national levels may not add up to the forecasts at the national level. To address this issue, we consider reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates, extending the methods of Hyndman et al. (2011) to functional time series, where age is considered as a continuum. The grouped functional time series methods are used to produce point forecasts of mortality rates that are aggregated appropriately across different disaggregation factors. For evaluating forecast uncertainty, we propose a bootstrap method for reconciling interval forecasts. Using the regional age-specific mortality rates in Japan, obtained from the Japanese Mortality Database, we investigate the one- to ten-step-ahead point and interval forecast accuracies between the independent and grouped functional time series forecasting methods. The proposed methods are shown to be useful for reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates at the national and sub-national levels. They also enjoy improved forecast accuracy averaged over different disaggregation factors. Supplemental materials for the article are available online.},

However, when it comes to time series forecasting, because of the inherent serial correlation and potential non-stationarity of the data, its application is not straightforward and often omitted by practitioners in favor of an out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation. In this paper, we show that the particular setup in which time series forecasting is usually performed using Machine Learning methods renders the use of standard K-fold CV possible. We present theoretical insights supporting our arguments. Furthermore, we present a simulation study where we show empirically that K-fold CV performs favourably compared to both OOS evaluation and other time-series-specific techniques such as non-dependent cross-validation.},

abstract = {The life care annuitythe integration of the life annuity with long-term care insurance coverageis intended to deal with major problems in the currently separate markets for life annuities and long-term care insurance. The integration would allow the inclusion of most of the population currently rejected by underwritingthose in poor health or lifestyles but who would not go immediately into long-term care claimwho also have lower life expectancies. We make use of the Health and Retirement Study, on individuals in retirement and their disability incidence, exploiting the panel nature of the survey to estimate transition probabilities in and out of disability states according to numerous demographic and health characteristics. This allows for analysis of disability and mortality risk across a number of dimensions. We find that different risk groups at age 65 have similar projected long-term care expenses, but that the level-periodic-premium structure of most long-term care insurance policies creates incentives for individuals to separate into different risk pools according to observable characteristics, justifying the underwriting observed on the market. Yet we also find that gender-rated life care annuities could succeed in pooling risks currently segmented in the market for long-term care insurance, thus qualifying individuals at or near retirement for permanent long-term care insurance coverage who do not currently qualify, and allowing for life annuities to be purchased more cheaply than in the stand-alone annuity market now subject to adverse selection.},

abstract = {Multiple cause-of-death data provides a valuable source of information that can be used to enhance health standards by predicting health related trajectories in societies with large populations. These data are often available in large quantities across U.S. states and require Big Data techniques to uncover complex hidden patterns. We design two different classes of models suitable for large-scale analysis of mortality data, a Hadoop-based ensemble of random forests trained over N-grams, and the DeepDeath, a deep classifier based on the recurrent neural network (RNN). We apply both classes to the mortality data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics and show that while both perform significantly better than the random classifier, the deep model that utilizes long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), surpasses the N-gram based models and is capable of learning the temporal aspect of the data without a need for building ad-hoc, expert-driven features.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We develop a Gaussian process (GP) framework for modeling mortality rates and mortality improvement factors. GP regression is a nonparametric, data-driven approach for determining the spatial dependence in mortality rates and jointly smoothing raw rates across dimensions, such as calendar year and age. The GP model quantifies uncertainty associated with smoothed historical experience and generates full stochastic trajectories for out-of-sample forecasts. Our framework is well suited for updating projections when newly available data arrives, and for dealing with “edge” issues where credibility is lower. We present a detailed analysis of GP model performance for US mortality experience based on the CDC (Center for Disease Control) datasets. We investigate the interaction between mean and residual modeling, Bayesian and non-Bayesian GP methodologies, accuracy of in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting, and stability of model parameters. We also document the general decline, along with strong age-dependency, in mortality improvement factors over the past few years, contrasting our findings with the Society of Actuaries (SOA) MP-2014 and -2015 models that do not fully reflect these recent trends.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Dahl2004,
abstract = {In life insurance, actuaries have traditionally calculated premiums and reserves using a deterministic mortality intensity, which is a function of the age of the insured only. Here, we model the mortality intensity as a stochastic process. This allows us to capture two important features of the mortality intensity: Time dependency and uncertainty of the future development. The advantage of introducing a stochastic mortality intensity is twofold. Firstly, it gives more realistic premiums and reserves, and secondly, it quantifies the risk of the insurance companies associated with the underlying mortality intensity. Having introduced a stochastic mortality intensity, we study possible ways of transferring the systematic mortality risk to other parties. One possibility is to introduce mortality-linked insurance contracts. Here the premiums and/or benefits are linked to the development of the mortality intensity, thereby transferring the systematic mortality risk to the insured. Alternatively, the insurance company can transfer some or all of the systematic mortality risk to agents in the financial market by trading derivatives depending on the mortality intensity. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Semi-closed form solutions for prices and Greeks (i.e. sensitivities of prices with respect to model parameters) of various GMBs under stochastic mortality are derived. Pricing and hedging is performed using an accurate, fast and efficient Fourier Space Time-stepping (FST) algorithm. The mortality component of the model is calibrated to the Australian male population. Sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to various parameters including guarantee levels, time to maturity, interest rates and volatilities. The hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing profit-and-loss distributions for an unhedged, statically and semi-statically hedged portfolios. The results provide a comprehensive analysis on pricing and hedging the longevity risk, interest rate risk and equity risk for the GMBs embedded in VAs, and highlight the benefits to insurance providers who offer those products.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

We also extend McKean's incomplete Fourier transform approach to solve the free boundary problem under Merton's framework, for a general jump size distribution. We show how the two methods are related to each other, and also to the Geske-Johnson compound option approach used by Gukhal (2001). The paper also derives results concerning the limit for the free boundary at expiry, and presents a numerical algorithm for solving the linked integral equation system for the American call price, delta and early exercise boundary. This scheme is applied to Merton's jump-diffusion model, where the jumps are log-normally distributed.},

Based on the paradigm of representation learning, we extend the LCmodel to multiple populations using neural networks, which automatically select an optimal model structure. We fit this model to mortality rates since 1950 for all countries in the Human Mortality Database and observe that the out-of-sample forecasting performance of the model is highly competitive.},

The paper sets out the static, full and customized swap-hedge for an annuity, and compares it with a dynamic, partial, and index-based hedge. We calibrate our model to the UK and Scottish populations. The effectiveness of static versus dynamic strategies depends on the rebalancing frequency of the second, on the relative costs, and on basis risk, which does not affect fully-customized, static hedges. We show that appropriately calibrated dynamic hedging strategies can still be reasonably effective, even at low rebalancing frequencies.},

We employ a competing risks proportional hazard model to allow for different causes of death. This method is important as some factors have unequal (and sometimes opposite) influence on the cause-specific mortality rates. We find that the often-found inverse correlation between socio-economic status and mortality is to a large degree absent among Danish women who die of cancer. In addition, for men the negative correlation between socio-economic status and mortality prevails for some diseases, but for women we find that factors such as being married, income, wealth and education are not significantly associated with higher life expectancy. Marriage increases the likelihood of dying from cancer for women, early retirement prolongs survival for men, and homeownership increases life expectancy in general.},

The primary conclusion of this line of research is that forecast accuracy can be substantially improved through the combination of multiple individual forecasts. Furthermore, simple combination methods often work reasonably well relative to more complex combinations. This paper provides a review and annotated bibliography of that literature, including contributions from the forecasting, psychology, statistics, and management science literatures. The objectives are to provide a guide to the literature for students and researchers and to help researchers locate contributions in specific areas, both theoretical and applied. Suggestions for future research directions include (1) examination of simple combining approaches to determine reasons for their robustness, (2) development of alternative uses of multiple forecasts in order to make better use of the information they contain, (3) use of combined forecasts as benchmarks for forecast evaluation, and (4) study of subjective combination procedures. Finally, combining forecasts should become part of the mainstream of forecasting practice. In order to achieve this, practitioners should be encouraged to combine forecasts, and software to produce combined forecasts easily should be made available. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

This study describes trends in socioeconomic mortality inequality in Australia for males and females aged 0-14, 15-24 and 25-64 years over the period 1985-1987 to 1995-1997. METHODS: Socioeconomic status (SES) was operationalized using the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage, an area-based measure developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Mortality differentials were examined using age-standardized rates, and mortality inequality was assessed using rate ratios, gini coefficients, and a measure of excess mortality. RESULTS: For both periods, and for each sex/age subgroup, death rates were highest in the most disadvantaged areas. The extent and nature of socioeconomic mortality inequality differed for males and females and for each age group: both increases and decreases in mortality inequality were observed, and for some causes, the degree of inequality remained unchanged. If it were possible to reduce death rates among the SES areas to a level equivalent to that of the least disadvantaged area, premature all-cause mortality for males in each age group would be lower by 22{\%}, 28{\%} and 26{\%} respectively, and for females, 35{\%}, 70{\%} and 56{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality burden in the Australian population attributable to socioeconomic inequality is large, and has profound and far-reaching implications in terms of the unnecessary loss of life, the loss of potentially economically productive members of society, and increased costs for the health care system.},

abstract = {Histogram time series (HTS) describe situations where a distribution of values is available for each instant of time. These situations usually arise when contemporaneous or temporal aggregation is required. In these cases, histograms provide a summary of the data that is more informative than those provided by other aggregates such as the mean. Some fields where HTS are useful include economy, official statistics and environmental science. This article adapts the k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) algorithm to forecast HTS and, more generally, to deal with histogram data. The proposed k-NN relies on the choice of a distance that is used to measure dissimilarities between sequences of histograms and to compute the forecasts. The Mallows distance and the Wasserstein distance are considered. The forecasting ability of the k-NN adaptation is illustrated with meteorological and financial data, and promising results are obtained. Finally, further research issues are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Institute of Forecasters.},

abstract = {We present a fully data driven strategy to incorporate continuous risk factors and geographical information in an insurance tariff. A framework is developed that aligns flexibility with the practical requirements of an insurance company, the policyholder and the regulator. Our strategy is illustrated with an example from property and casualty (P{\&}C) insurance, namely a motor insurance case study. We start by fitting generalized additive models (GAMs) to the number of reported claims and their corresponding severity. These models allow for flexible statistical modeling in the presence of different types of risk factors: categorical, continuous, and spatial risk factors. The goal is to bin the continuous and spatial risk factors such that categorical risk factors result which captures the effect of the covariate on the response in an accurate way, while being easy to use in a generalized linear model (GLM). This is in line with the requirement of an insurance company to construct a practical and interpretable tariff that can be explained easily to stakeholders. We propose to bin the spatial risk factor using Fisher's natural breaks algorithm and the continuous risk factors using evolutionary trees. GLMs are fitted to the claims data with the resulting categorical risk factors. We find that the resulting GLMs approximate the original GAMs closely, and lead to a very similar premium structure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Western countries mortality dropped throughout the 20th century, but over and above the long-term falling trend, the death rate has oscillated over time. It has been postulated that these short-term oscillations may be related to changes in the economy. METHODS: To ascertain if these short-term oscillations are related to fluctuations in the economy, age-adjusted total mortality and mortality for specific population groups, ages and causes of death were transformed into rate of change or percentage deviation from trend, and were correlated and regressed on indicators of the US economy during the 20th century, transformed in the same way. RESULTS: Statistically and demographically significant results show that the decline of total mortality and mortality for different groups, ages and causes accelerated during recessions and was reduced or even reversed during periods of economic expansion-with the exception of suicides which increase during recessions. In recent decades these effects are stronger for women and non-whites. CONCLUSIONS: Economic expansions are associated with increasing mortality. Suggested pathways to explain this deceleration or even reversal of the secular decline in mortality during economic expansions include both material and psychosocial effects of the economic upturns: expansion of traffic and industrial activity directly raising injury-related mortality, decreased immunity levels (owing to rising stress and reduction of sleep time, social interaction and social support), and increased consumption of tobacco, alcohol and saturated fats.},

Considering ”environmental pollution” and ”innovation failure”, an improved SBM-DEA efficiency measurement model was constructed to measure the green technology innovation efficiency of China's high-tech industry clusters. Lasso regression was used to screen out the factors affecting the green technology innovation efficiency of high-tech industry in each cluster area. On this basis, quantile regression method is used to study the influence degree and regional differences of various influencing factors on green innovation efficiency of high-tech industry at different quantile. Meanwhile, DEA-tobit model is used for robustness test. The research shows that in each cluster area, the factors that significantly affect the green innovation efficiency of high-tech industry are different, and the degree of influence of each factor on the innovation efficiency at different quantile is also different. Combining the empirical results with the reality of high-tech industries in various regions, the corresponding policy recommendations are put forward.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Reconfiguration of emergency services could lead to patients with life-threatening conditions travelling longer distances to hospital. Concerns have been raised that this could increase the risk of death. We aimed to determine whether distance to hospital was associated with mortality in patients with life-threatening emergencies. METHODS We undertook an observational cohort study of 10,315 cases transported with a potentially life-threatening condition (excluding cardiac arrests) by four English ambulance services to associated acute hospitals, to determine whether distance to hospital was associated with mortality, after adjustment for age, sex, clinical category and illness severity. RESULTS Straight-line ambulance journey distances ranged from 0 to 58 km with a median of 5 km, and 644 patients died (6.2{\%}). Increased distance was associated with increased risk of death (odds ratio 1.02 per kilometre; 95{\%} CI 1.01 to 1.03; p{\textless}0.001). This association was not changed by adjustment for confounding by age, sex, clinical category or illness severity. Patients with respiratory emergencies showed the greatest association between distance and mortality. CONCLUSION Increased journey distance to hospital appears to be associated with increased risk of mortality. Our data suggest that a 10-km increase in straight-line distance is associated with around a 1{\%} absolute increase in mortality.},

abstract = {Symbolic data analysis (SDA) is an emerging area of statistics based on aggregating individual level data into group-based distributional summaries (symbols), and then developing statistical methods to analyse them. It is ideal for analysing large and complex datasets, and has immense potential to become a standard inferential technique in the near future. However, existing SDA techniques are either non-inferential, do not easily permit meaningful statistical models, are unable to distinguish between competing models, and are based on simplifying assumptions that are known to be false. Further, the procedure for constructing symbols from the underlying data is erroneously not considered relevant to the resulting statistical analysis. In this paper we introduce a new general method for constructing likelihood functions for symbolic data based on a desired probability model for the underlying classical data, while only observing the distributional summaries. This approach resolves many of the conceptual and practical issues with current SDA methods, opens the door for new classes of symbol design and construction, in addition to developing SDA as a viable tool to enable and improve upon classical data analyses, particularly for very large and complex datasets. This work creates a new direction for SDA research, which we illustrate through several real and simulated data analyses.},

abstract = {Cross-validation (CV) is a simple and universal tool to estimate generalization ability, however, existing CVs do not work well for periodicity, overlapping or correlation of series. The corresponding three criteria aimed at describing these properties are presented. Based on them, we put forward a novel Markov cross-validation (M-CV), whose data partition can be seen as a Markov process. The partition ensures that samples in each subset are neither too close nor too far. In doing so, overfitting model or information loss of series, which may result in underestimation or overestimation of the error, can be avoided. Furthermore, subsets from M-CV partition could well represent the original series, and it may be extended to time series or stream data sampling. Theoretical analysis shows that M-CV is the unique one which meets all of above criteria among current CVs. In addition, the error estimation on subsets is proved to have less variance than that on original series, therefore it ensures the stability of M-CV. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed M-CV has lower bias, variance and time consumption than other CVs.},

The traditional perspective that economic recessions lower health and raise mortality has been challenged by recent findings that reveal mortality is actually procyclical. The epidemiology of the phenomenon - traffic accidents, cardiovascular disease, and smoking and drinking - suggests that socioeconomically vulnerable populations might be disproportionately at risk of "working themselves to death" during periods of heightened economic activity. In this paper, I examine mortality by individual characteristic during the 1980s and 1990s using the U.S. National Longitudinal Mortality Study. I find scant evidence that disadvantaged groups are significantly more exposed to procyclical mortality. Rather, working-age men with more education appear to bear a heavier burden, while those with little education experience countercyclical mortality.},

We apply the method to U.S. males and females from 1959 to 2015. Results show divergence between time trends of hump and observed deaths, both for all-cause and cause-specific mortality. The study of the hump shape reveals age, period, and cohort effects, suggesting that it is formed by a complex combination of different forces of biological and socioeconomic nature. Male and female humps share some traits in all-cause shape and trend, but they also differ by their overall magnitude and cause-specific contributions. Notably, among males, the contributions of traffic and other accidents were progressively replaced by those of suicides, homicides, and poisonings; among females, traffic accidents remained the major contributor to the hump.},

abstract = {Inequality in the distribution of adult length of life - defined as age at death in the population aged 15 and over - is studied for virtually all countries of the world using a new database with over 9000 life tables covering a period of up to two centuries. The data reveal huge variation among countries and time periods in the degree to which the available years of life are distributed equally among the population. Most length of life inequality (about 90{\%}) is within-country inequality. Our findings make clear that measures of length of life inequality should be adjusted for life expectancy to get a more relevant indicator of length of life differentials across populations. At similar levels of life expectancy, substantial differences in inequality are observed, even among highly developed countries. Expressed as premature mortality, inequality may be 35-70{\%} higher in the most unequal countries compared to the most equal ones. Countries that reached a certain level of life expectancy earlier in time than other countries, and countries that improved their life expectancy more quickly than others, experienced higher levels of inequality. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The article examines changes to specific types of circulatory disease, focussing on ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and cerebrovascular disease (stroke). The main changes are highlighted and the article explains how data can be adjusted to take account of these changes so that trends over time can be analysed. The article then looks at the impact of the changes on baselines for Government targets to reduce mortality from circulatory diseases. The number of deaths assigned to circulatory diseases increases by 3-4 per cent as a result of the introduction of ICD-10, replacing ICD-9. For cerebrovascular diseases specifically, the increase is 9 per cent for females and 13 per cent for males. Trends in mortality from IHD are unaffected by the introduction of ICD-10. However, the number of deaths assigned to acute myocardial infarction, which forms part of IHD, decreases by around 10 per cent when ICD-10 is used instead of ICD-9.},

abstract = {Contemporary information on the fraction of cancers that potentially could be prevented is useful for priority setting in cancer prevention and control. Herein, the authors estimate the proportion and number of invasive cancer cases and deaths, overall (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) and for 26 cancer types, in adults aged 30 years and older in the United States in 2014, that were attributable to major, potentially modifiable exposures (cigarette smoking; secondhand smoke; excess body weight; alcohol intake; consumption of red and processed meat; low consumption of fruits/vegetables, dietary fiber, and dietary calcium; physical inactivity; ultraviolet radiation; and 6 cancer-associated infections). The numbers of cancer cases were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Cancer Institute; the numbers of deaths were obtained from the CDC; risk factor prevalence estimates were obtained from nationally representative surveys; and associated relative risks of cancer were obtained from published, large-scale pooled analyses or meta-analyses. In the United States in 2014, an estimated 42.0{\%} of all incident cancers (659,640 of 1570,975 cancers, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) and 45.1{\%} of cancer deaths (265,150 of 587,521 deaths) were attributable to evaluated risk factors. Cigarette smoking accounted for the highest proportion of cancer cases (19.0{\%}; 298,970 cases) and deaths (28.8{\%}; 169,180 deaths), followed by excess body weight (7.8{\%} and 6.5{\%}, respectively) and alcohol intake (5.6{\%} and 4.0{\%}, respectively). Lung cancer had the highest number of cancers (184,970 cases) and deaths (132,960 deaths) attributable to evaluated risk factors, followed by colorectal cancer (76,910 cases and 28,290 deaths). These results, however, may underestimate the overall proportion of cancers attributable to modifiable factors, because the impact of all established risk factors could not be quantified, and many likely modifiable risk factors are not yet firmly established as causal. Nevertheless, these findings underscore the vast potential for reducing cancer morbidity and mortality through broad and equitable implementation of known preventive measures.

abstract = {A new market for so-called mortality derivatives is now appearing with survivor swaps (also called mortality swaps), longevity bonds and other specialized solutions. The development of these new financial instruments is triggered by the increased focus on the systematic mortality risk inherent in life insurance contracts, and their main focus is thus to allow the life insurance companies to hedge their systematic mortality risk. At the same time, this new class of financial contract is interesting from an investors point of view, since it increases the possibility for an investor to diversify the investment portfolio. The systematic mortality risk stems from the uncertainty related to the future development of the mortality intensities. Mathematically, this uncertainty is described by modeling the underlying mortality intensities via stochastic processes. We consider two different portfolios of insured lives, where the underlying mortality intensities are correlated, and study the combined financial and mortality risk inherent in a portfolio of general life insurance contracts. In order to hedge this risk, we allow for investments in survivor swaps and derive risk-minimizing strategies in markets where such contracts are available. The strategies are evaluated numerically.},

In this article, we explain key issues with this metric: In the short run, it is subject to estimation uncertainty for small and moderately sized portfolios; and, more critically, in the long run, it converges to 100{\%} even if the underwriting is systematically biased. As an alternative, we propose and discuss a set of new metrics based on the difference in (temporary) life expectancies.

@book{Arnold-Gaille2018,
abstract = {The increase in life expectancy over the past several decades has been impressive and represents a key challenge for institutions that provide life insurance products. Indeed, when a new actuarial table is released with updated survival and death rates, such institutions need to update the amount of mathematical reserve that they need to set aside to guarantee the future payments of their annuities. As mortality forecasting techniques are currently well developed, it is relatively easy to forecast mortality over several decades and to directly use these forecast rates in the determination of the mathematical reserve needed to guarantee annuity payments. Future mortality evolution is then directly incorporated into the liabilities valuation of an institution, and it is thus commonly believed that such liabilities should not require much updating when a new actuarial table is released. In this paper, we demonstrate that contrary to this common belief, institutions that use generational tables (namely, tables including future mortality evolution) will most likely need to make more important adjustments (positive or negative) to their liabilities than will institutions using periodic (static) tables whenever a new table is released. By using three very different models to project mortality, we demonstrate that our findings are inherent in the required long horizons of the forecasts needed in the generational approach, with the uncertainty surrounding the forecast values increasing with the horizon. Therefore, generational tables may introduce more instability in a pension institution's accounts than periodic tables.},

abstract = {After a period of general convergence, the 1960s were marked by the divergence between the life expectancies of eastern European countries, where all progress came to a halt, and those of the rest of Europe where health care made large strides. A hierarchical analysis of age-specific mortality patterns shows that this divergence goes together with the development of very different patterns of age at death; in the countries of eastern Europe, and especially in the USSR, excess mortality at adult ages is spectacularly high. Cause-specific analysis reveals the decisiv e role played by two kinds of diseases. On the one hand, "man-made diseases" (alcoholism, smoking, car accidents, etc.) have continued to increase in the east, whereas they were curbed in the West starting in the 1960s. On the other hand, eastern Europe was unable to join the cardiovascular revolution that had enabled the west to increase its life expectancy levels. The considerable divergence between eastern and western Europe should not hide the differences that still remain among western countries. Indeed, mortality patterns are changing in the west, and the traditional opposition between north and south is undergoing radical transformations.},

abstract = {This paper considers only the vital events of demographic measurement, the factors influencing the rate at which those events occur and then investigates the consequences of patterns of these events. It reviews the state of the art of age, period and cohort analysis for demographic dependent variables. Major examples of such analyses are given in both mortality and fertility studies. In the area of mortality the conventional approach to such analysis apears to be well suited to a wide range of applications yielding useful results. The reasons for this suitability are: early childhood experience is important in many major disease and death processes, so that cohorts are legitimately viewed as acquiring early on a certain fixed susceptibility; data sometimes stretch back far enough that stationary standards of age patterns can be developed empirically, and applied to later experience; and, logarithmic or logistic transformations linearize comparisons of age schedules or mortality so that standard statistical procedures are suitable. Applications of age, period, and cohort analysis are not always routine; external constraints are required, in the form of theoretically based and mathematically expressed age patterns of mortality, in order to distinguish effectively between period and cohort effects. A set of models of age patterns of mortality that are based on cohort as well as period experience could be constructed with useful applications. With fertility analysis the conventional approach is much less suitable. Once goal directed behavior is introduced, empirical examinations must be based on theories or assumptions about how such goals are formulated and pursued. Conventional analysis might suffice only if one is prepared to accept the assumption that all pertinent goals and strategies are formulated before the initiation of childbearing and remain unaffected by subsequent events. This assumption is untenable for modern developed populations and the forms of analysis appropriate to age period cohort investigations of fertility will have to develop along with theories of reproductive behavior.},

@article{Villamil2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Background: While, at its inception in 1993, the health care system in Colombia was publicized as a paradigm to be copied across the developing world, numerous problems in its implementation have led to, what is now, an inefficient and crisis-ridden health system. Furthermore, as a result of inappropriate tools to measure the quality of the health service providers, several corruption scandals have arisen in the country. This study attempts to tackle this situation by proposing a strategy for the quality assessment of the health service providers (Entidades Promotoras de Salud, EPS) in the Colombian health system. In particular, as a case study, the quality of the treatment of stomach cancer is analyzed. Methods: The study uses two complementary techniques to address the problem. These techniques are applied based on data of the treatment of gastric cancer collected on a nation-wide scale by the Colombian Ministry of Health and Welfare. First, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and the Malmquist Index (MI) are used to establish the most efficient EPS's within the system, according to indicators such as opportunity indicators. Second, sequential clustering algorithm, related to process mining a field of data mining, is used to determine the medical history of all patients and to construct typical care pathways of the patients belonging to efficient and inefficient EPS's. Lastly, efforts are made to identify traits and differences between efficient and inefficient EPS's. Results: Efficient and inefficient EPS were identified for the years 2010 and 2011. Additionally, a Malmquist Index was used to calculate the relative changes in the efficiency of the health providers. Using these efficiency rates, the typical treatment path of patients with gastric cancer was found for two EPSs: one efficient and another inefficient. Finally, the typical traits of the care pathways were established. Conclusions: Combining DEA and process mining proved to be a powerful approach understanding the problem and gaining valuable insight into the inner workings of the Colombian Health System, especially in terms of the treatment process performed by health care providers in critical illnesses such as cancer. However, no sufficiently compelling results were found to establish the contribution of such a combination to evaluate the quality in the delivery of health services.},

abstract = {The reasons for classifying causes of death into aggregate groups are discussed and the impact of mortality partitions on analyses of mortality is described. Special emphasis is given to a mortality partition that distinguishes between intrinsic causes of death that arise primarily from the failure of biological processes that originate within an organism, and extrinsic causes of death that are primarily imposed on the organism by outside forces. Examples involving mortality data for mice, dogs, and humans are used to illustrate how this mortality partition infuses biological reasoning into mathematical models used to analyze and predict senescent-determined mortality, enhances the information content of the mortality schedules generated from these models, improves mortality comparisons between populations within species separated by time or geographic location, and provides a logical pathology endpoint for making interspecies comparisons of mortality. By bridging biology and the statistics of mortality, a mortality partition based on intrinsic and extrinsic causes of death provides both structure and direction for research on senescent-determined mortality.},

@article{Benedek1855,
abstract = {The first clinical evidence that an extract of animal adrenocortical tissue could counteract human adrenal failure was demonstrated in 1930. As chemical analyses of cortical extracts proceeded, mainly in the laboratories of Kendall at the Mayo Clinic and Reichstein in Zurich, it became evident that there is not one cortical hormone, but that all are steroids. By 1940 it was understood that there are two categories: those that cause sodium and fluid retention and those that counteract shock and inflammation. Structurally the presence or lack of oxygenation at C11 on the steroid skeleton was critical. In 1948 the first patient with rheumatoid arthritis was treated with cortisone and soon thereafter other rheumatologic patients received cortisone or, to stimulate native cortisone production, ACTH. Oral and intra-articular administration of cortisone and hydrocortisone began in 1950-51. Several lines of research to produce cortisone semi-synthetically showed some success by 1952. Between 1954 and 1958 six synthetic steroids were introduced for systemic anti-imflammatory therapy. By 1960 all of the toxic effects of chronic corticosteroid administration had been described, as well as protocols to withdraw such drugs while minimising symptoms of cortical insufficiency. To enable use of lower corticosteroid dosages, companion use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs began in the late 1950s, with phenylbutazone the first. In the 1970s the introduction of methotrexate and other anti-metabolites further circumscribed the dosages and indications for corticosteroids in the rheumatic diseases.},

abstract = {Retirements from the workforce can be split between those who are forced to retire early specifically for health reasons referred to as ill-health retirements and all other retirements referred to as normal-health retirements. Rates of ill-health retirement increase with age and are higher for females than males. Consequently, the mortality experience of ill-health retirement pensioners will become more important in the future as pension schemes increase their normal retirement age in line with increases in life expectancy and the proportion of women in the workforce and therefore in occupational pension schemes increases. This paper seeks to model the mortality of ill-health retirements from occupational pension schemes in the United Kingdom in the period immediately following retirement (reverse select mortality) and over the longer term (ultimate mortality) allowing for age at retirement. Females experience a longer reverse select period than males and for both males and females the improvement in mortality rates over the reverse select period is greatest at younger ages. Post the reverse select period the effect of age at retirement decreases over time with ultimate mortality rates converging by the mid-eighties for males and females.},

@article{Cairns2006b,
abstract = {It is now widely accepted that stochastic mortality - the risk that aggregate mortality might differ from that anticipated - is an important risk factor in both life insurance and pensions. As such it affects how fair values, premium rates, and risk reserves are calculated. This paper makes use of the similarities between the force of mortality and interest rates to examine how we might model mortality risks and price mortality-related instruments using adaptations of the arbitrage-free pricing frameworks that have been developed for interest-rate derivatives. In so doing, the paper pulls together a range of arbitrage-free (or risk-neutral) frameworks for pricing and hedging mortality risk that allow for both interest and mortality factors to be stochastic. The different frameworks that we describe - short-rate models, forward-mortality models, positive-mortality models and mortality market models - are all based on positive-interest-rate modeling frameworks since the force of mortality can be treated in a similar way to the short-term risk-free rate of interest. While much of this paper is a review of the possible framewoks, the key new development is the introduction of mortality market models equivalent to the LIBOR and swap market models in the interest-rate literature. These frameworks can be applied to a great variety of mortality-related instruments, from vanilla longevity bonds to exotic mortality derivatives.},

Consistent with previous studies, we found increasing inequality in mortality at older ages. For children and young adults below age 20, however, we found strong mortality improvements that were most pronounced in poorer counties, implying a strong decrease in mortality inequality. These younger cohorts will form the future adult U.S. population, so this research suggests that inequality in old-age mortality is likely to decline. P},

abstract = {Health systems rely on commercial prediction algorithms to identify and help patients with complex health needs. We show that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from 17.7 to 46.5{\%}. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts.},

@inproceedings{DeGrey2006,
abstract = {Criticisms of demographers by other demographers have become frequent in scientific literature, generally consisting of accusations that trends observed in the recent past have been extrapolated unjustifiably into the future. Demographers, along with their colleagues in the actuarial profession, are in an invidious position in this regard, knowing full well that extrapolation is almost always only minimally justifiable, but knowing also that their readers, colleagues, and sources of funding tend to be much more interested in the future than in the past. It is unfortunate that, while actuaries typically resolve this dilemma by emphasizing the limitations of their methods and thereby lowering expectations that their predictions will be accurately fulfilled, demographers are more prone to respond combatively, attempting to reinforce the credibility of their extrapolations by recourse to data from areas in which their expertise is less tested, such as biology. This is valuable in that it raises the profile of the debate on the likely rate of scientific progress relevant to mortality rates, but it also runs the risk of lowering the technical quality of that debate, by telling policy makers and the public what they want to hear and thereby entrenching their expectations without recourse to the relevant biological facts. Extrapolations based on plausible sequences of scientific advances and the sociopolitical responses to them, summarized in this article, have led to the prediction of four-digit life expectancies of cohorts born in the 21st century and possibly even in the 20th. This prediction has attracted inevitable ridicule from prominent demographers, but being founded on science and sociology rather than on history it may be much more reliable than the extrapolations that those demographers presently prefer.},

abstract = {In this paper, we adopt a financial measure (net present value ratio) to assess the extent of the redistribution of lifetime earnings operated by the introduction of a notional defined contri- bution (NDC) system in the Italian PAYGO system. Our simulations are based on a rep- resentative sample of the Italian population consisting of individuals born between 1975 and 2000. We identify three channels of redistribution: between genders (from men to women), along educational lines (from the less-well-educated to the highly educated) and between di- verse lifetime-earnings quintiles (from the poor to the rich). This happens because certain groups of individuals systematically live shorter-than-average lives (men, the less well-educated and the poor), whereas others live longer-than-average lives (women, the highly educated and the rich) and, at the same time, the NDC system does not take into account such differences. Comparison between the old defined benefit system and the reformed NDC one shows that intergenerational fairness has improved sensibly but differences between gender and edu- cational levels remained nearly the same. Sensitivity analysis and the consideration of survival pensions in our simulations confirm the general trends of our base case.},

In this paper, we first provide a description of the traditional mortality model which is deterministic but also allows quite easily for a representation of the uncertainty relating to individual mortality. Then, we discuss a stochastic approach to the modeling of the uncertainty relating to aggregate mortality. Due to the importance of mortality evolution in respect of post-retirement liabilities, we refer to a portfolio of immediate life annuities (or pension annuities). We assume that a (projected) life table which provides a best-estimate assessment of annuitants' future mortality is available. We show that the life table, from which a deterministic description of future mortality can be obtained, can be used as the basic input of appropriate stochastic models. In particular, we consider a Bayesian-inference setting for updating the parameters of the stochastic model according to the experienced mortality.},

Graphical methods used to identify cohort patterns are discussed. A number of limitations and difficulties are identified that mean that the conclusions about the predominance of cohort effects are less robust than often assumed. It is argued that alternative explanations should be considered and that the concentration on birth cohorts with particularly advantaged patterns may distort research priorities.},

For instance, when studying divergence in life expectancy, this method allows researchers to more easily contrast age-specific mortality trends between populations by controlling for initial age-specific mortality differences. Two approaches are assessed: (1) an additive change method that uses logic similar to cause-of-death decomposition, and (2) a contour decomposition method that extends the stepwise replacement algorithm along an age-period demographic contour. The two approaches produce similar results, but the contour method is more widely applicable. We provide a full description of the contour replacement method and examples of its application to life expectancy and lifetime disparity differences between the United States and England and Wales in the period 1980--2010.},

Interesting new methods from the machine learning literature have been introduced in epidemiologic studies, such as random forest and neural networks. However, a priori, an investigator will not know which algorithm to select and may wish to try several. Here I apply the super learner, an ensembling machine learning approach that combines multiple algorithms into a single algorithm and returns a prediction function with the best cross-validated mean squared error. Super learning is a generalization of stacking methods. I used super learning in the Study of Physical Performance and Age-Related Changes in Sonomans (SPPARCS) to predict death among 2,066 residents of Sonoma, California, aged 54 years or more during the period 1993-1999. The super learner for predicting death (risk score) improved upon all single algorithms in the collection of algorithms, although its performance was similar to that of several algorithms. Super learner outperformed the worst algorithm (neural networks) by 44{\%} with respect to estimated cross-validated mean squared error and had an R2 value of 0.201. The improvement of super learner over random forest with respect to R2 was approximately 2-fold. Alternatives for risk score prediction include the super learner, which can provide improved performance.},

abstract = {Mortality levels for subpopulations, such as countries in a region or provinces within a country, generally change in a similar fashion over time, as a result of common historical experiences in terms of health, culture, and economics. Forecasting mortality for such populations should consider the correlation between their mortality levels. In this perspective, we suggest using multilinear component techniques to identify a common time trend and then use it to forecast coherently the mortality of subpopulations. Moreover, this multiway approach is performed on life table deaths by referring to Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa) methodology. Compositional data are strictly positive values summing to a constant and represent part of a whole. Life table deaths are compositional by definition because they provide the age composition of deaths per year and sum to the life table radix. In bilinear models the use of life table deaths treated as compositions generally leads to less biased forecasts than other commonly used models by not assuming a constant rate of mortality improvement. As a consequence, an extension of this approach to multiway data is here presented. Specifically, a CoDa adaptation of the Tucker3 model is implemented for life table deaths arranged in three-dimensional arrays indexed by time, age, and population. The proposed procedure is used to forecast the mortality of Canadian provinces in a comparative study. The results show that the proposed model leads to coherent forecasts.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To quantify the effect of the upsurge of violence on life expectancy and life span inequality in Mexico after 2005. METHODS: We calculated age- and cause-specific contributions to changes in life expectancy and life span inequality conditional on surviving to age 15 years between 1995 and 2015. We analyzed homicides, medically amenable conditions, diabetes, ischemic heart diseases, and traffic accidents by state and sex. RESULTS: Male life expectancy at age 15 years increased by more than twice in 1995 to 2005 (1.17 years) than in 2005 to 2015 (0.55 years). Life span inequality decreased by more than half a year for males in 1995 to 2005, whereas in 2005 to 2015 the reduction was about 4 times smaller. Homicides for those aged between 15 and 49 years had the largest effect in slowing down male life expectancy and life span inequality. Between 2005 and 2015, three states in the north experienced life expectancy losses while 5 states experienced increased life span inequality. CONCLUSIONS: Ten years into the upsurge of violence, Mexico has not been able to reduce the homicide levels to those before 2005. Life expectancy and life span inequality stagnated since 2005 for young men at the national level. In some states, males live shorter lives than in 2005, on average, and experience higher uncertainty in their eventual death.},

Our study is done in a multiple-curve setup reflecting the various funding constraints (or costs) involved, allowing one to investigate the question of interaction between bilateral counterparty risk and funding. The first task is to define a suitable notion of no arbitrage price in the presence of various funding costs. This is the object of this paper, where we develop an “additive, multiple curve” extension of the classical “multiplicative (discounted), one curve” risk-neutral pricing approach. We derive the dynamic hedging interpretation of such an “additive risk-neutral” price, starting by consistency with pricing by replication in the case of a complete market. This is illustrated by a completely solved example building over previous work by Burgard and Kjaer.},

@article{Brønnum-Hansen2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Author(s). Background Social inequality trends in life expectancy are not informative as to changes in social disparity in the age-at-death distribution. The purpose of the study was to investigate social differentials in trends and patterns of adult mortality in Denmark. Methods Register data on income and mortality from 1986 to 2014 were used to investigate trends in life expectancy, life disparity and the threshold age that separates {\^{a}} € premature' and late' deaths. Mortality compression was quantified and compared between income quartiles. Results Since 1986, male life expectancy increased by 4.2 years for the lowest income quartile and by 8.4 years for the highest income quartile. The clear compression of mortality apparent in the highest income quartile did not occur for the lowest income quartile. Premature and late deaths accounted both by 2.1 years of the increase in life expectancy in the lowest income quartile and by 6.0 and 2.4 years, respectively, in the highest income quartile. Life expectancy increased by 5.2 years among women in the lowest income quartile, 2.4 years due to premature deaths and 2.8 years due to late deaths. The gain in life expectancy among women in the highest income quartile of 5.6 years was distributed by 5.0 and 0.6 years due to premature and late deaths, respectively. Conclusion The study demonstrates that the increasing social gap in mortality appears differently in the change of the age-at-death distribution. Thus, no compression of mortality was seen in the lowest income quartile. The results do not provide support for a uniformly extension of pension age for all.},

The ALDA is a variant of a pure deferred annuity contract that is acquired by installments, adjusted for consumer price inflation, and pays off toward the end of the human life cycle. The ALDA concept is aimed at the growing population of North Americans without access to a traditional defined benefit (DB) pension plan and the implicit longevity insurance that a DB plan contains. I show that under quite reasonable pricing assumptions, a consumer can invest or allocate {\$}1 per month, while saving for retirement, and receive between {\$}20 and {\$}40 per month in benefits, assuming the deductible in this insurance policy is set high enough. The ALDA concept might go a long way in mitigating the psychological barrier to voluntary lump-sum annuitization.},

Also, the interest rate paid on cash collateral can influence pricing and this is likely to become a more important consideration because recent regulatory proposals are expected to lead to an increase in collateral requirements.2 The usual approach to dealing with counterparty credit risk is to first calculate a “no-default value.” This value is then reduced by the expected loss due to the possibility of a default by the counterparty and increased by the expected gain due to the possibility of a default by the dealer. The expected loss due to a possible default by the counterparty is referred to as the credit value adjustment (CVA) and the expected gain due to a possible default by the dealer is referred to as the debit (or debt) value adjustment (DVA).3 A further adjustment for the interest paid on cash collateral may be necessary. We will refer to this as the collateral rate adjustment (CRA).},

abstract = {Cohort effects are important factors in determining the evolution of human mortality for certain countries. Extensions of dynamic mortality models with cohort features have been proposed in the literature to account for these factors under the generalised linear modelling framework. In this paper we approach the problem of mortality modelling with cohort factors incorporated through a novel formulation under a state-space methodology. In the process we demonstrate that cohort factors can be formulated naturally under the state-space framework, despite the fact that cohort factors are indexed according to year-of-birth rather than year. Bayesian inference for cohort models in a state-space formulation is then developed based on an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, allowing for the quantification of parameter uncertainty in cohort models and resulting mortality forecasts that are used for life expectancy and life table constructions. The effectiveness of our approach is examined through comprehensive empirical studies involving male and female populations from various countries. Our results show that cohort patterns are present for certain countries that we studied and the inclusion of cohort factors are crucial in capturing these phenomena, thus highlighting the benefits of introducing cohort models in the state-space framework. Forecasting of cohort models is also discussed in light of the projection of cohort factors.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a traditional lecture-based curriculum versus a modified "flipped classroom" curriculum of cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal physiology delivered to first-year graduate students. Students in both courses were provided the same notes and recorded lectures. Students in the modified flipped classroom were required to watch the prerecorded lectures before class and then attend class, where they received a quiz or homework covering material in each lecture (valued at 25{\%} of the final grade) followed by a question and answer/problem-solving period. In the traditional curriculum, attending lectures was optional and there were no quizzes. Evaluation of effectiveness and student performance was achieved by having students in both courses take the same multiple-choice exams. Within a comparable group of graduate students, participants in the flipped course scored significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) on the cardiovascular, respiratory, and weighted cumulative sections by an average of {\textgreater}12 percentage points. Exam averages for students in the flipped course also tended to be higher on the renal section by ∼11 percentage points (P = 0.06). Based on our experience and responses obtained in blinded student surveys, we propose that the use of homework and in-class quizzes were critical motivating factors that likely contributed to the increase in student exam performance. Taken together, our findings support that the flipped classroom model is a highly effective means in which to disseminate key physiological concepts to graduate students.},

This corresponds to the ideas of Nobel laureate R.C. Merton whose implementation has never been published. We show with an illustration that our proposed practical algorithm reproduces the theoretical results after a savings period of around 30 years by using daily, monthly, weekly or yearly updates of the investment positions. We calculate the percentiles of the final accumulated wealth distribution for the adjusted implementation. In the simulated illustration, we observe that the adjusted values converge to the theoretical values of the percentiles when the frequency of update increases. We conclude that monthly adjustments result in a practical way to implement theoretical results that were obtained under the hypothesis of a continuous process by Donnelly {\textless}italic{\textgreater}et al.{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} (2015).

abstract = {Estimation of future mortality rates still plays a central role among life insurers in pricing their products and managing longevity risk. In the literature on mortality modeling, a wide number of stochastic models have been proposed, most of them forecasting future mortality rates by extrapolating one or more latent factors. The abundance of proposed models shows that forecasting future mortality from historical trends is non-trivial. Following the idea proposed in Deprez et al. (2017), we use machine learning algorithms, able to catch patterns that are not commonly identifiable, to calibrate a parameter (the machine learning estimator), improving the goodness of fit of standard stochastic mortality models. The machine learning estimator is then forecasted according to the Lee-Carter framework, allowing one to obtain a higher forecasting quality of the standard stochastic models. Out-of sample forecasts are provided to verify the model accuracy.},

abstract = {A number of authors have attempted to defend ecologic (aggregate) studies by claiming that the goal of those studies is estimation of ecologic (contextual or group-level) effects rather than individual-level effects. Critics of these attempts point out that ecologic effect estimates are inevitably used as estimates of individual effects, despite disclaimers. A more subtle problem is that ecologic variation in the distribution of individual effects can bias ecologic estimates of contextual effects. The conditions leading to this bias are plausible and perhaps even common in studies of ecosocial factors and health outcomes because social context is not randomized across typical analysis units (administrative regions). By definition, ecologic data contain only marginal observations on the joint distribution of individually defined confounders and outcomes, and so identify neither contextual nor individual-level effects. While ecologic studies can still be useful given appropriate caveats, their problems are better addressed by multilevel study designs, which obtain and use individual as well as group-level data. Nonetheless, such studies often share certain special problems with ecologic studies, including problems due to inappropriate aggregation and problems due to temporal changes in covariate distributions.},

abstract = {Statistics on mortality related to each disease are usually based on the so-called underlying cause of death, which is selected from the diseases declared on the standardized death certificate using international rules. However, the assumption that each death is caused by exactly one disease is debatable, particularly with an aging population in an era where infectious diseases are replaced by chronic and degenerative diseases. The need to consider multiple causes of death has been acknowledged in epidemiologic research, with a growing body of literature producing statistics based on any mention of a disease on the death certificate. Yet there has not been a formal framework proposed for the statistical modeling of death arising from multiple causes. We propose a model for multiple cause of death data grounded on an empirical approach that assigns weights to each cause on the death certificate. We describe how this model for multiple-cause mortality, which extends the usual competing risks model used to conceptualize single-cause mortality, can serve to study the burden and etiology of mortality related to each disease, particularly using Cox regression methodology. We discuss how the multiple-cause, single-cause, and "any-mention" approaches compare in this regard. A simulation study and an application to a study of socioeconomic inequalities in mortality show the value of the proposed methods for exploiting this precious source of data to gain new insights, especially for certain diseases.},

In Part 3A, we developed certain properties for both these types of stochastic bridge, and in Part 3B we investigated retail prices and wages. In this paper, we investigate the remainder of many of our data series, relating to shares and interest rates. We conclude that, regardless of the form of the annual model, the monthly data within each year can be modelled by Brownian bridges, usually on the logarithm of the principal variable. But in no case is a simple Brownian bridge enough, and all series have their own peculiarities. Overall, however, our modelling produces simulations that are realistic in comparison with the known data. Many of our findings would apply to any similar model used for simulation over time. Our results have considerable importance for financial economics. We reconcile the conflict between the long-term mean-reverting modelling of Schiller and the short-term random walk modelling of Fama. This conclusion therefore has very wide significance.},

abstract = {This article presents an analysis of trends in mortality differentials and life expectancy by average relative earnings for male Social Security-covered workers aged 60 or older. Because average relative earnings are measured at the peak of the earnings distribution (ages 45-55), it is assumed that they act as a rough proxy for socioeconomic status. The historical literature reviewed in this analysis generally indicates that mortality differentials by socioeconomic status have not been constant over time. For this study, time trends are examined by observing how mortality differentials by average relative earnings have been changing over 29 years of successive birth cohorts that encompass roughly the first third of the 20th century. Deaths for these birth cohorts are observed at ages 60-89 from 1972 through 2001, encompassing roughly the last third of the 20th century. The large size and long span of death observations allow for disaggregation by age and year-of-birth groups in the estimation of mortality differentials by socioeconomic status. This study finds a difference in both the level and the rate of change in mortality improvement over time by socioeconomic status for male Social Security-covered workers. Average relative earnings (measured as the relative average positive earnings of an individual between ages 45 and 55) are used as a proxy for adult socioeconomic status. In general, for birth cohorts spanning the years 1912-1941 (or deaths spanning the years 1972-2001 at ages 60-89), the top half of the average relative earnings distribution has experienced faster mortality improvement than has the bottom half. Specifically, male Social Security-covered workers born in 1941 who had average relative earnings in the top half of the earnings distribution and who lived to age 60 would be expected to live 5.8 more years than their counterparts in the bottom half. In contrast, among male Social Security-covered workers born in 1912 who survived to age 60, those in the top half of the earnings distribution would be expected to live only 1.2 years more than those in the bottom half. The life expectancy estimates in this article represent one possible outcome under one set of assumptions. These projections should not be regarded as an accurate depiction of the future. Specifically, this study adopts a simple projection method in which differentials are assumed to follow the pattern observed over the last 30 years of the 20th century for the first 30 years of the 21st century. This assumption lacks theoretical underpinnings because the causes of the widening differentials observed over the past 30 years have not been determined. On the one hand, if the trend of widening mortality differentials by year of birth observed over the past 30 years does not continue, the projection method used in this analysis could lead to an overestimation of future differences in life expectancy between socioeconomic groups. On the other hand, if mortality differentials do not narrow by age as observed in the past, the projection method used could lead to an underestimation of the differences in life expectancy between socioeconomic groups aged 60 or older.},

abstract = {We develop a framework for computing the total valuation adjustment (XVA) of a European claim accounting for funding costs, counterparty credit risk, and collateralization. Based on no-arbitrage arguments, we derive backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) associated with the replicating portfolios of long and short positions in the claim. This leads to the definition of buyer's and seller's XVA, which in turn identify a no-arbitrage interval. In the case that borrowing and lending rates coincide, we provide a fully explicit expression for the unique XVA, expressed as a percentage of the price of the traded claim, and for the corresponding replication strategies. In the general case of asymmetric funding, repo and collateral rates, we study the semilinear partial differential equations (PDE) characterizing buyer's and seller's XVA and show the existence of a unique classical solution to it. To illustrate our results, we conduct a numerical study demonstrating how funding costs, repo rates, and counterparty risk contribute to determine the total valuation adjustment.},

@article{Milevsky2016,
abstract = {There is growing interest in the design of pension annuities that insure against idiosyncratic longevity risk while pooling and sharing systematic risk. This is partially motivated by the desire to reduce capital and reserve requirements while retaining the value of mortality credits; see for example, Piggott et al. (2005) or Donnelly et al. (2014). In this paper, we generalize the natural retirement income tontine introduced by Milevsky and Salisbury (2015) by combining heterogeneous cohorts into one pool. We engineer this scheme by allocating tontine shares at either a premium or a discount to par based on both the age of the investor and the amount they invest. For example, a 55-year old allocating {\$}10,000 to the tontine might be told to pay {\$}200 per share and receive 50 shares, while a 75-year old allocating {\$}8,000 might pay {\$}40 per share and receive 200 shares. They would all be mixed together into the same tontine pool and each tontine share would have equal income rights. The current paper addresses existence and uniqueness issues and discusses the conditions under which this scheme can be constructed equitably — which is distinct from fairly — even though it isn't optimal for any cohort. As such, this also gives us the opportunity to compare and contrast various pooling schemes that have been proposed in the literature and to differentiate between arrangements that are socially equitable, vs. actuarially fair vs. economically optimal.},

The current record stands at 122 years, 164 days and has held for over 20 years and is more than four and three quarter years higher than the previous record. The value and persistence of this record have surprised some researchers, with some even questioning its veracity. There have been previous attempts in the literature to answer questions about how long this record might stand and whether it is truly exceptional but the focus has been mainly on the record ages, using ad hoc tools. This article contributes in two new ways. First we study lifespan records via the (inter-) record times and second we make use of specific tools from statistical Records Theory. We find that the occurrence of the present record was not surprising. We estimate around a 25{\%} chance that the record would have survived until now and around a one in five chance that it will survive until 2050, demonstrating remarkable persistence.},

abstract = {This paper presents a toolkit for measuring and analyzing inter-individual inequality in length of life by Gini coefficient. Gini coefficient and four other inequality measures are defined on the length-of-life distribution. Properties of these measures and their empirical testing on mortality data suggest a possibility for different judgements about the direction of changes in the degree of inequality by using different measures. A new computational procedure for the estimation of Gini coefficient from life tables is developed and tested on about four hundred real life tables. The estimates of Gini coefficient are precise enough even for abridged life tables with the final age group of 85+. New formulae have been developed for the decomposition of differences between Gini coefficients by age and cause of death. A new method for decomposition of age- components into effects of mortality and composition of population by group is developed. Temporal changes in the effects of elimination of causes of death on Gini coefficient are analyzed. Numerous empirical examples show: Lorenz curves for Sweden, Russia and Bangladesh in 1995, proportional changes in Gini coefficient and four other measures of inequality for the USA in 1950-1995 and for Russia in 1959- 2000. Further shown are errors of estimates of Gini coefficient when computed from various types of mortality data of France, Japan, Sweden and the USA in 1900-95, decompositions of the USA-UK difference in life expectancies and Gini coefficients by age and cause of death in 1997. As well, effects of elimination of major causes of death in the UK in 1951-96 on Gini coefficient, age-specific effects of mortality and educational composition of the Russian population on changes in life expectancy and Gini coefficient between 1979 and 1989. Illustrated as well are variations in life expectancy and Gini coefficient across 32 countries in 1996-1999 and associated changes in life expectancy and Gini coefficient in Japan, Russia, Spain, the USA, and the UK in 1950-1999. Variations in Gini coefficient, with time and across countries, are driven by historical compression of mortality, but also by varying health and social patterns.},

abstract = {Financial valuation OF GMWBs: We develop a variety of methods for assessing the cost and value of a very popular 'rider' available to North American investors on variable annuity (VA) policies called a Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB). The GMWB promises to return the entire initial investment, albeit spread over an extended period of time, regardless of subsequent market performance. First, we take a static approach that assumes individuals behave passively and holds the product to maturity. We show how the product can be decomposed into a Quanto Asian Put plus a generic term-certain annuity. At the other extreme of consumer behavior, the dynamic approach leads to an optimal stopping problem akin to pricing an American put option, albeit complicated by the non-traditional payment structure. Our main result is that the No Arbitrage hedging cost of a GMWB ranges from 73 to 160 basis points of assets. In contrast, most products in the market only charge 30-45 basis points. Although we suggest a number of behavioral reasons for the apparent under-pricing of this feature in a typically overpriced VA market, we conclude by arguing that current pricing is not sustainable and that GMWB fees will eventually have to increase or product design will have to change in order to avoid blatant arbitrage opportunities. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Patterns of diversity in age at death are examined using e (†), a dispersion measure that equals the average expected lifetime lost at death. We apply two methods for decomposing differences in e (†). The first method estimates the contributions of average levels of mortality and mortality age structures. The second (and newly developed) method returns components produced by differences between age- and cause-specific mortality rates. The United States is close to England and Wales in mean life expectancy but has higher life expectancy losses and lacks mortality compression. The difference is determined by mortality age structures, whereas the role of mortality levels is minor. This is related to excess mortality at ages under 65 from various causes in the United States. Regression on 17 country-series suggests that e (†) correlates with income inequality across countries but not across time. This result can be attributed to dissimilarity between the age- and cause-of-death structures of temporal mortality reduction and intercountry mortality variation. It also suggests that factors affecting overall mortality decrease differ from those responsible for excess lifetime losses in the United States compared with other countries. The latter can be related to weaknesses of health system and other factors resulting in premature death from heart diseases, amenable causes, accidents and violence.},

abstract = {With cloud computing, Internet-of-things, wireless sensors, social media, fast storage and retrieval, etc., organizations and enterprises have access to unprecedented amounts and varieties of data. Current risk analysis methodology and applications are experiencing related advances and breakthroughs. For example, highway operations data are readily available, and making use of them reduces risks of traffic crashes and travel delays. Massive data of financial and enterprise systems support decision making under risk by individuals, industries, regulators, etc. In this introductory article, we first discuss the meaning of big data for risk analysis. We then examine recent advances in risk analysis with big data in several topic areas. For each area, we identify and introduce the relevant articles that are featured in the special issue. We conclude with a discussion on future research opportunities.},

@article{Zhou2019a,
abstract = {Recently, it has been argued that capital markets may share some of the overwhelming longevity risk exposures borne by the pension and life insurance industries. The transfer of risk can be accomplished by trading standardized derivatives such as q-forwards that are linked to published mortality indexes. To strategize such trades, one may utilize longevity Greeks, which are analogous to equity Greeks that have been used extensively in managing stock price risk. In this article, we first derive three important longevity Greeks—delta, gamma, and vega—on the basis of an extended version of the Lee-Carter model that incorporates stochastic volatility. We then study the properties of each longevity Greek and estimate the levels of effectiveness that different longevity Greek hedges can possibly achieve. The results reveal several interesting facts; for example, in a delta–vega hedge formed by q-forwards, the choice of reference ages does not materially affect hedge effectiveness, but the choice of times to maturity does. These facts may aid insurers to better formulate their hedge portfolios and issuers of mortality-linked securities to determine what security structures are more likely to attract liquidity.},

abstract = {Natural disasters such as hurricanes can cause substantial population out-migration. However, the magnitude of population movements is difficult to estimate using only traditional sources of migration data. We utilize data obtained from Facebook's advertising platform to estimate out-migration from Puerto Rico in the months after Hurricane Maria. We find evidence to indicate a 17.0{\%} increase in the number of Puerto Rican migrants present in the US over the period October 2017 to January 2018. States with the biggest increases were Florida, New York and Pennsylvania, and there were disproportionately larger increases in the 15-30 age groups and for men compared to women. Additionally, we find evidence of subsequent return migration to Puerto Rico over the period January 2018 to March 2018. These results illustrate the power of complementing social media and traditional data to monitor demographic indicators over time, particularly after a shock, such as a natural disaster, to understand large changes in population characteristics.},

abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are widely used in the fitting of generalized linear models (GLMs). Such model fitting is somewhat of an art form, requiring suitable trickery and tuning to obtain results in which one can have confidence. A wide range of practical issues arise. The focus here is on parameter identifiability and posterior propriety. In particular, we clarify that nonidentifiability arises for usual GLMs and discuss its implications for simulation-based model fitting. Because often some part of the prior specification is vague, we consider whether the resulting posterior is proper, providing rather general and easily checked results for GLMs. We also show that if a Gibbs sampler is run with an improper posterior, then it may be possible to use the output to obtain meaningful inference for certain model unknowns.},

abstract = {Background: Statistical theory predicts that failing to control for unobserved heterogeneity in a Gompertz mortality risk model attenuates the estimated income-mortality gradient toward zero. Objective: I assess the empirical importance of controlling for unobserved heterogeneity in a Gompertz mortality risk model when estimating the income-mortality gradient. The analysis is carried out using individual-level administrative data from the Netherlands over the period 1996-2012. Methods: I estimate a Gompertz mortality risk model in which unobserved heterogeneity has a gamma distribution and left-truncation of life durations is explicitly taken into account. Results: I find that, despite a strong and significant presence of unobserved heterogeneity in both the male and female samples, failure to control for unobserved heterogeneity yields only a small and insignificant attenuation bias in the negative income-mortality gradient. Conclusions: The main finding, a small and insignificant attenuation bias in the negative income-mortality gradient when failing to control for unobserved heterogeneity, is positive news for the many empirical studies, whose estimations of the income-mortality gradient ignore unobserved heterogeneity.},

abstract = {We consider a modification to the Poisson common factor model and utilise a generalised linear model (GLM) framework that incorporates a smoothing process and a set of linear constraints. We extend the standard GLM model structure to adopt Lagrange methods and P -splines such that smoothing and constraints are applied simultaneously as the parameters are estimated. Our results on Australian, Canadian and Norwegian data show that this modification results in an improvement in mortality projection in terms of producing more accurate forecasts in the out-of-sample testing. At the same time, projected male-to-female ratio of death rates at each age converges to a constant and the residuals of the models are sufficiently random, indicating that the use of smoothing does not adversely affect the fit of the model. Further, the irregular patterns in the estimates of the age-specific parameters are moderated as a result of smoothing and this model can be used to produce more regular projected life tables for pricing purposes.},

It describes trends in cigarette smoking over time, observes how prevalence by age has changed over the last four decades, then examines pseudo-cohort trends in cigarette smoking for both men and women in Great Britain. The findings show that, for men, there were generational reductions in smoking prevalence, and when this trend began to slow, a trend for generational reductions in heavy smoking started. The remaining smokers were less likely to smoke 20 or more cigarettes than those in previous cohorts. However both these trends have now stopped, suggesting the levels of cigarette consumption we are observing today among men may be maintained in future generations if these patterns continue.},

We emphasize corporate credit risk and the pricing of credit derivatives. Applications of affine processes that are mentioned include survival analysis, dynamic term-structure models, and option pricing with stochastic volatility and jumps. The default-risk applications include default correlation, particularly in first-to-default settings.

@article{Murata2013,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between ambulance distance to hospitals and mortality from acute diseases using the national database in Japan. DESIGN: Geospatial ecological study. SETTING: We collected the data of transport distance to hospitals from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database and that of mortality per 100 000 from some acute diseases from the database of life tables by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 108 314 patients (40 882 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 31 632 patients with brain infarction, 4992 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 30 808 patients with pneumonia) were referred in Japan in 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated the association between the mean transport distance to hospitals and the mortality from acute diseases using simple linear regression analysis. This correlation was evaluated separately for each acute disease. RESULTS: The mean transport distances to hospitals were 8.1 km for acute myocardial infarction, 8.3 km for brain infarction, 9.5 km for subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 7.6 km for pneumonia, whereas the mortalities per 100,000 were 34.6 for acute myocardial infarction, 60.4 for brain infarction, 11.2 for subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 91.6 for pneumonia. Simple linear regression analysis revealed significant positive correlations between transport distance and mortality per 100,000 for acute myocardial infarction and brain infarction (R2 = 0.315 and 0.398, P {\textless} .001, respectively). Otherwise, moderate positive correlations between transport distance and mortality per 100,000 were shown for subarachnoid hemorrhage and pneumonia (R2 = 0.112, P {\textless} .012 and .233, P {\textless} .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the ambulance distance to hospitals significantly influences the risk of mortality for some acute diseases in Japan. Further studies are needed to confirm this association.},

abstract = {Model misspecification has significant impacts on data envelopment analysis (DEA) efficiency estimates. This paper discusses the four most widely-used approaches to guide variable specification in DEA. We analyze efficiency contribution measure (ECM), principal component analysis (PCA-DEA), a regression-based test, and bootstrapping for variable selection via Monte Carlo simulations to determine each approach's advantages and disadvantages. For a three input, one output production process, we find that: PCA-DEA performs well with highly correlated inputs (greater than 0.8) and even for small data sets (less than 300 observations); both the regression and ECM approaches perform well under low correlation (less than 0.2) and relatively larger data sets (at least 300 observations); and bootstrapping performs relatively poorly. Bootstrapping requires hours of computational time whereas the three other methods require minutes. Based on the results, we offer guidelines for effectively choosing among the four selection methods. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Gillespie2014,
abstract = {In the past six decades, lifespan inequality has varied greatly within and among countries even while life expectancy has continued to increase. How and why does mortality change generate this diversity? We derive a precise link between changes in age-specific mortality and lifespan inequality, measured as the variance of age at death. Key to this relationship is a young-old threshold age, below and above which mortality decline respectively decreases and increases lifespan inequality. First, we show for Sweden that shifts in the threshold's location have modified the correlation between changes in life expectancy and lifespan inequality over the last two centuries. Second, we analyze the post-World War II (WWII) trajectories of lifespan inequality in a set of developed countries-Japan, Canada, and the United States-where thresholds centered on retirement age. Our method reveals how divergence in the age pattern of mortality change drives international divergence in lifespan inequality. Most strikingly, early in the 1980s, mortality increases in young U.S. males led to a continuation of high lifespan inequality in the United States; in Canada, however, the decline of inequality continued. In general, our wider international comparisons show that mortality change varied most at young working ages after WWII, particularly for males. We conclude that if mortality continues to stagnate at young ages yet declines steadily at old ages, increases in lifespan inequality will become a common feature of future demographic change.},

The relative risk of mortality between the poorest and richest income quintile was 1.88 (1.45, 2.44) times higher and this translated into a life expectancy gap (at age twenty) of six years. Having more than twelve years of education was also associated with a significantly lower risk of death.

Such a problem arises naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance problem as the most important and well-known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection. The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the methods.},

The aim is to construct a kind of "taxonomy" of the statistical papers by organizing and clustering them in main themes. In this sense being identified in a cluster means being important enough to be uncluttered in the vast and interconnected world of the statistical research. Since the main statistical research topics naturally born, evolve or die during time, we will also develop a dynamic clustering strategy, where a group in a time period is allowed to migrate or to merge into different groups in the following one. Results show that statistics is a very dynamic and evolving science, stimulated by the rise of new research questions and types of data.},

abstract = {Various types of structures that enable a group of individuals to pool their mortality risk have been proposed in the literature. Collectively, the structures are called pooled annuity funds. Since the pooled annuity funds propose different methods of pooling mortality risk, we investigate the connections between them and find that they are genuinely different for a finite heterogeneous membership profile. We discuss the importance of actuarial fairness, defined as the expected benefits equalling the contributions for each member, in the context of pooling mortality risk and comment on whether actuarial unfairness can be seen as solidarity between members. We show that, with a finite number of members in the fund, the group self-annuitization scheme is not actuarially fair: some members subsidize the other members. The implication is that the members who are subsidizing the others may obtain a higher expected benefit by joining a fund with a more favourable membership profile. However, we find that the subsidies are financially significant only for very small or highly heterogeneous membership profiles.},

abstract = {Recently, a new approach for optimization of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) was suggested and tested with several applications. For continuous distributions, CVaR is defined as the expected loss exceeding Value-at Risk (VaR). However, generally, CVaR is the weighted average of VaR and losses exceeding VaR. Central to the approach is an optimization technique for calculating VaR and optimizing CVaR simultaneously. This paper extends this approach to the optimization problems with CVaR constraints. In particular, the approach can be used for maximizing expected returns under CVaR constraints. Multiple CVaR constraints with various confidence levels can be used to shape the profit/loss distribution. A case study for the portfolio of S{\&}P 100 stocks is performed to demonstrate how the new optimization techniques can be implemented.},

The exact analytical formulas for theoretical mortality rates based on Gaussian linear scalar filter models have been derived. The theoretical values obtained in both cases were compared with theoretical mortality rates based on a classical Lee–Carter model, and verified on the basis of empirical Polish mortality data. The obtained results confirm the usefulness of the switched model based on the continuous non-Gaussian process for modeling mortality rates.},

abstract = {This article proposes a neural-network approach to predict and simulate human mortality rates. This semi-parametric model is capable to detect and duplicate non-linearities observed in the evolution of log-forces of mortality. The method proceeds in two steps. During the first stage, a neural-network-based generalization of the principal component analysis summarizes the information carried by the surface of log-mortality rates in a small number of latent factors. In the second step, these latent factors are forecast with an econometric model. The term structure of log-forces of mortality is next reconstructed by an inverse transformation. The neural analyzer is adjusted to French, UK and US mortality rates, over the period 1946–2000 and validated with data from 2001 to 2014. Numerical experiments reveal that the neural approach has an excellent predictive power, compared to the Lee–Carter model with and without cohort effects.},

@article{Timonin2016,
abstract = {Background: Over the past half century the global tendency for improvements in longevity has been uneven across countries. This has resulted in widening of inter-country disparities in life expectancy. Moreover, the pattern of divergence appears to be driven in part by processes at the level of country groupings defined in geopolitical terms. A systematic quantitative analysis of this phenomenon has not been possible using demographic decomposition approaches as these have not been suitably adapted for this purpose. In this paper we present an elaboration of conventional decomposition techniques to provide a toolkit for analysis of the inter-country variance, and illustrate its use by analyzing trends in life expectancy in developed countries over a 40-year period. Methods: We analyze trends in the population-weighted variance of life expectancy at birth across 36 developed countries and three country groups over the period 1970-2010. We have modified existing decomposition approaches using the stepwise replacement algorithm to compute age components of changes in the total variance as well as variance between and within groups of Established Market Economies (EME), Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and the Former Soviet Union (FSU). The method is generally applicable to the decomposition of temporal changes in any aggregate index based on a set of populations. Results: The divergence in life expectancy between developed countries has generally increased over the study period. This tendency dominated from the beginning of 1970s to the early 2000s, and reversed only after 2005. From 1970 to 2010, the total standard deviation of life expectancy increased from 2.0 to 5.6 years among men and from 1.0 to 3.6 years among women. This was determined by the between-group effects due to polarization between the EME and the FSU. The latter contrast was largely fueled by the long-term health crisis in Russia. With respect to age, the increase in the overall divergence was attributable to between-country differences in mortality changes at ages 15-64 years compared to those aged 65 and older. The within-group variance increased, especially among women. This change was mostly produced by growing mortality differences at ages 65 and older. Conclusions: From the early 1970s to the mid-2000s, the strong divergence in life expectancy across developed countries was largely determined by the between-group variance and mortality polarization linked to the East--West geopolitical division.

Our analysis shows that the residuals of many of the series are much fatter-tailed than in a normal distribution.

We also extend McKean's incomplete Fourier transform approach to solve the free boundary problem under Merton's framework, for a general jump size distribution. We show how the two methods are related to each other, and also to the Geske-Johnson compound option approach used by Gukhal (2001). The paper also derives results concerning the limit for the free boundary at expiry, and presents a numerical algorithm for solving the linked integral equation system for the American call price, delta and early exercise boundary. This scheme is applied to Merton's jump-diffusion model, where the jumps are log-normally distributed.},

The product-ratio functional forecasting method models and forecasts the geometric mean of subpopulation rates and the ratio of subpopulation rates to product rates. Coherence is imposed by constraining the forecast ratio function through stationary time series models. The method is applied to sex-specific data for Sweden and state-specific data for Australia.

abstract = {This paper discusses the specific problems of age-period-cohort (A-P-C) analysis within the general framework of interaction assessment for two-way cross-classified data with one observation per cell. The A-P-C multiple classification model containing the effects of age groups (rows), periods of observation (columns), and birth cohorts (diagonals of the two-way table) is characterized as one of a special class of models involving interaction terms assumed to have very specific forms. The so-called A-P-C identification problem, which results from the use of a particular interaction structure for detecting cohort effects, is shown to manifest itself in the form of an exact linear dependency among the columns of the design matrix. The precise relationship holding among these columns is derived, as is an explicit formula for the bias in the parameter estimates resulting from an incorrect specification of an assumed restriction on the parameters required to solve the normal equations. Current methods for modeling A-P-C data are critically reviewed, an illustrative numerical example is presented, and one potentially promising analysis strategy is discussed. However, gien the large number of possible sources for error in A-P-C analyses, it is strongly recommended that the results of such analyses be interpreted with a great deal of caution.},

Objective To estimate age-standardized mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases by county. Design and Setting Deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics and population counts from the US Census Bureau, the National Center for Health Statistics, and the Human Mortality Database from 1980 through 2014 were used. Validated small area estimation models were used to estimate county-level mortality rates from all cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation and flutter, rheumatic heart disease, aortic aneurysm, peripheral arterial disease, endocarditis, and all other cardiovascular diseases combined. Exposures The 3110 counties of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures Age-standardized cardiovascular disease mortality rates by county, year, sex, and cause. Results From 1980 to 2014, cardiovascular diseases were the leading cause of death in the United States, although the mortality rate declined from 507.4 deaths per 100 000 persons in 1980 to 252.7 deaths per 100 000 persons in 2014, a relative decline of 50.2{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI], 49.5{\%}-50.8{\%}). In 2014, cardiovascular diseases accounted for more than 846 000 deaths (95{\%} UI, 827-865 thousand deaths) and 11.7 million years of life lost (95{\%} UI, 11.6-11.9 million years of life lost). The gap in age-standardized cardiovascular disease mortality rates between counties at the 10th and 90th percentile declined 14.6{\%} from 172.1 deaths per 100 000 persons in 1980 to 147.0 deaths per 100 000 persons in 2014 (posterior probability of decline {\textgreater}99.9{\%}). In 2014, the ratio between counties at the 90th and 10th percentile was 2.0 for ischemic heart disease (119.1 vs 235.7 deaths per 100 000 persons) and 1.7 for cerebrovascular disease (40.3 vs 68.1 deaths per 100 000 persons). For other cardiovascular disease causes, the ratio ranged from 1.4 (aortic aneurysm: 3.5 vs 5.1 deaths per 100 000 persons) to 4.2 (hypertensive heart disease: 4.3 vs 17.9 deaths per 100 000 persons). The largest concentration of counties with high cardiovascular disease mortality extended from southeastern Oklahoma along the Mississippi River Valley to eastern Kentucky. Several cardiovascular disease conditions were clustered substantially outside the South, including atrial fibrillation (Northwest), aortic aneurysm (Midwest), and endocarditis (Mountain West and Alaska). The lowest cardiovascular mortality rates were found in the counties surrounding San Francisco, California, central Colorado, northern Nebraska, central Minnesota, northeastern Virginia, and southern Florida. Conclusions and Relevance Substantial differences exist between county ischemic heart disease and stroke mortality rates. Smaller differences exist for diseases of the myocardium, atrial fibrillation, aortic and peripheral arterial disease, rheumatic heart disease, and endocarditis.},

The study considered the population affiliated to the Defined Contribution scheme (RAIS) and evaluated it under the parameters of both pension schemes. The results revealed a wider coverage under the RAIS scheme than under the Defined Benefit scheme (RPM). Additionally, it evaluated the impact of different parameter modifications made under each system on these variables. Results showed that easing some of the parameters, such as the minimum week requirement in order to obtain a Minimum Pension Guarantee, has a positive impact on coverage as well as distribution.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTMany common stochastic mortality models can be formulated as a generalized linear model (GLM). When these GLMs are used to model one year-death probabilities, qx, deaths are assumed to be binomially distributed, and the canonical logit link function has been used by default. In this work we present the quantile function of the Generalized Extreme Value distribution as an alternative link function to the standard canonical logit link and show that its theoretical advantages enable a better fit for mortality models in cases when data are highly imbalanced or sparse. We provide an example that shows that this link function also enables superior fits to mortality data at the very highest ages in the case of the Cairns Blake Dowd family of mortality models.},

@article{Fu2011,
abstract = {In studying temporally ordered rates of events, epidemiologists, demographers, and social scientists often find it useful to distinguish three different temporal dimensions, namely, age (age of the participants involved), time period (the calendar year or other temporal period for recording the events of interest), and cohort (birth cohort or generation). Age-period-cohort (APC) analysis aims to analyze age-year-specific archived event rates to capture temporal trends in the events under investigation. However, in the context of tables of rates, the well-known relationship among these three factors, Period − Age = Cohort, makes the parameter estimation of the APC multiple classification model difficult. The identification problem of the parameter estimation has been studied since the 1970s and still remains in debate. Recent developments in this regard include the intrinsic estimator (IE) method, the autoregressive cohort model, the age-period-cohort-characteristic (APCC) model, the regression splines model, the smoothing cohort model, and the hierarchical APC model. O'Brien (2011; pp. 419-452, this issue) makes a further contribution in studying constrained estimators, particularly the IE, in the APC models. The authors, however, have important disagreements with O'Brien as to what the statistical properties of the IE are and how the estimates from the IE should be interpreted. The authors point out these disagreements to conclude the article.},

abstract = {Summary The final report of the World Health Organization Commission on the Social Determinants of Health (CSDH), published in 2008, affirmed that social injustice was killing on a grand scale, with a toxic combination of ‘poor social policies and programmes, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics' being responsible for producing and reinforcing health inequalities. It provided a comprehensive evidence-based discussion of pervasive inequalities of health in many countries, demonstrating the presence of a social gradient in health outcomes associated with the unfair distribution of the social determinants of health. The social determinants of health include the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, and the fundamental drivers of these conditions: the distribution of power; money; and resources. Following publication of the {\{}CSDH{\}} report and recommendations for action, the {\{}UK{\}} Government commissioned a Strategic Review of Health Inequalities in England. This article provides an overview and reflection on the findings from the {\{}CSDH{\}} and the Strategic Review of Health Inequalities in England, reviewing the case for putting fairness at the heart of all policy making. In the process, it highlights the need for action on the social determinants of health in order to address health inequalities and the social gradient in health outcomes.},

As a result, harmonizing across diierent kinds of estimates or data sources can be diicult. Moreover in countries like the United States, that do not have a national registry system, estimates of internal migration typically rely on survey data that can require over a year from data collection to publication. In addition, each survey can ask only a limited set questions about migration (e.g., where did you live a year ago? where did you live eve years ago?). We leverage a sample of geo-referenced Twiier tweets for about 62,000 users, spanning the period between 2010 and 2016, to estimate a series of US internal migration nows under varying time intervals and durations. Our rndings, expressed in terms of 'migration curves', document, for the erst time, the relationships between short-term mobility and long-term migration. .e results open new avenues for demographic research. More speciically, future directions in-clude the use of migration curves to produce probabilistic estimates of long-term migration from short-term (and vice versa) and to nowcast mobility rates at diierent levels of spatial and temporal granularity using a combination of previously published Ameri-can Community Survey data and up-to-date data from a panel of Twiier users.},

Unlike some other studies we base our analysis on the configuration of thousands of mortality data of old people, not just the few oldest old. We find compelling statistical evidence that there is indeed an upper limit to the life span of men and to that of women for all the 30 years we consider and, moreover, that there are no indications of trends in these upper limits over the last 30 years, despite the fact that the number of people reaching high age (say 95 years) was almost tripling. We also present estimates for the endpoints, for the force of mortality at very high age, and for the so-called perseverance parameter.},

abstract = {Our first paper reviewed methods for modelling variation in cancer incidence and mortality rates in terms of either period effects or cohort effects in the general multiplicative risk model. There we drew attention to the difficulty of attributing regular trends to either period or cohort influences. In this paper we turn to the more realistic problem in which neither period nor cohort effects alone lead to an adequate description of the data. We describe the age-period-cohort model and show how its ambiguities surrounding regular trends 'intensify'. We recommend methods for presenting the results of analyses based upon this model which minimize the serious risk of misleading implications and critically review previous suggestions. The discussion is illustrated by an analysis of breast cancer mortality in Japan with special reference to the phenomenon of 'Clemmesen's hook'.},

Life disparity is a measure of how much lifespans differ among individuals. We define a death as premature if postponing it to a later age would decrease life disparity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In 89 of the 170 years from 1840 to 2009, the country with the highest male life expectancy also had the lowest male life disparity. This was true in 86 years for female life expectancy and disparity. In all years, the top several life expectancy leaders were also the top life disparity leaders. Although only 38{\%} of deaths were premature, fully 84{\%} of the increase in life expectancy resulted from averting premature deaths. The reduction in life disparity resulted from reductions in early-life disparity, that is, disparity caused by premature deaths; late-life disparity levels remained roughly constant.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The countries that have been the most successful in averting premature deaths have consistently been the life expectancy leaders. Greater longevity and greater equality of individuals' lifespans are not incompatible goals. Countries can achieve both by reducing premature deaths.},

abstract = {The final report of the World Health Organization Commission on the Social Determinants of Health (CSDH), published in 2008, affirmed that social injustice was killing on a grand scale, with a toxic combination of 'poor social policies and programmes, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics' being responsible for producing and reinforcing health inequalities. It provided a comprehensive evidence-based discussion of pervasive inequalities of health in many countries, demonstrating the presence of a social gradient in health outcomes associated with the unfair distribution of the social determinants of health. The social determinants of health include the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, and the fundamental drivers of these conditions: the distribution of power; money; and resources. Following publication of the CSDH report and recommendations for action, the UK Government commissioned a Strategic Review of Health Inequalities in England. This article provides an overview and reflection on the findings from the CSDH and the Strategic Review of Health Inequalities in England, reviewing the case for putting fairness at the heart of all policy making. In the process, it highlights the need for action on the social determinants of health in order to address health inequalities and the social gradient in health outcomes.},

abstract = {Background Less attention has been paid to mortality trends across income groups than those measured by other socioeconomic indicators. This study assessed the change in life expectancy by income over 20{\&}emsp14;years in the Finnish general population. Methods Life expectancy among 35-year-olds by household income quintiles was studied. Change in life expectancy from 1988-92 to 2003-7 was decomposed by age and cause of death. The dataset contained 754 087 deaths by oversample of 80{\%} of all deaths during the period. Results The gap in life expectancy between the highest and the lowest income quintiles widened during the study period by 5.1{\&}emsp14;years among men and 2.9{\&}emsp14;years among women, and in 2007 it stood at 12.5{\&}emsp14;years and 6.8{\&}emsp14;years, respectively. Stagnation in the lowest income group was the main reason for the increased disparity for both sexes. Increasing mortality attributable to alcohol-related diseases and increasing or stagnating mortality for many cancers, as well as a slower decline in mortality due to ischaemic heart disease among men in the lowest income quintile, were the most significant factors increasing the gap. Conclusions The increasing gap in life expectancy was mostly due to the stagnation of mortality in the lowest income quintile and especially because of the increasing mortality in alcohol-related diseases. The increase in disparity may be more extreme when using income instead of occupational class or education, possibly because income identifies a lower and economically more deprived segment on a social hierarchy more clearly. The results identify a clear need to tackle the specific health problems of the poorest.},

Subsequently, the review distinguishes knowledge achieved over the last years into (i) what we know, (ii) what we are not sure about, and (iii) what we don't know. In the first two areas, we explore the difference between explanation and prediction, the existence of an optimal model, the performance of machine learning methods on time series forecasting tasks, the difficulties with predicting non-stable environments, the performance of judgment, and the value-added of exogenous variables. The article concludes with the importance of (thin and) fat tails, the challenges and advances in causal inference, and the role of luck.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commit-ment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current prob-lems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

abstract = {Population migration is a major determinant of an area's age-sex structure and socio-economic characteristics. The suggestion that migration can contribute to an increase or decrease in place-specific rates of illness is not new. However, differences in health status between small geographical locations that may be affected by the inter-relationships between health, area-based deprivation and migration are under-researched. Using the Office for National Statistics (ONS) England and Wales Longitudinal Study (LS) 1971-1991, this research tracks individuals to identify any systematic sorting of people that has contributed to the area-level relationships between health (limiting long-term illness and mortality) and deprivation (Carstairs quintiles). The results demonstrate that among the young, migrants are generally healthier than non-migrants. Migrants who move from more to less deprived locations are healthier than migrants who move from less to more deprived locations. Within less deprived areas migrants are healthier than non-migrants but within deprived areas migrants are less healthy than non-migrants. Over the 20 year period, the largest absolute flow is by relatively healthy migrants moving away from more deprived areas towards less deprived areas. The effect is to raise ill-health and mortality rates in the origins and lower them in the destinations. This is reinforced by a significant group of people in poor health who move from less to more deprived locations. In contrast, a small group of unhealthy people moved away from more deprived into less deprived areas. These countercurrents of less healthy people have a slight ameliorating effect on the health-deprivation relationship. Whilst health-deprivation relationships are more marked for migrants there are also health (dis-) benefits for non-migrants if their location becomes relatively more or less deprived over time. Overall we found that between 1971 and 1991, inequalities in health increased between the least and most deprived areas, compared with the health-deprivation relationship which would have existed if peoples' locations and deprivation patterns had stayed geographically constant. Migration, rather than changes in the deprivation of the area that non-migrants live in, accounts for the large majority of change.},

Analyzing this trajectory is crucial for understanding biological and sociocultural processes that determine the span of life. Here we reveal a fundamental regularity. Two straight lines describe the joint rise of life expectancy and lifespan equality: one for primates and the second one over the full range of human experience from average lifespans as low as 2 y during mortality crises to more than 87 y for Japanese women today. Across the primate order and across human populations, the lives of females tend to be longer and less variable than the lives of males, suggesting deep evolutionary roots to the male disadvantage. Our findings cast fresh light on primate evolution and human history, opening directions for research on inequality, sociality, and aging.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of valuating and hedging life insurance contracts that are subject to systematic mortality risk in the sense that the mortality intensity of all policy-holders is affected by some underlying stochastic processes. In particular, this implies that the insurance risk cannot be eliminated by increasing the size of the portfolio and appealing to the law of large numbers. We propose to apply techniques from incomplete markets in order to hedge and valuate these contracts. We consider a special case of the affine mortality structures considered by Dahl [Dahl, M., 2004. Stochastic mortality in life insurance: market reserves and mortality-linked insurance contracts. Insurance Math. Econom. 35, 113-136], where the underlying mortality process is driven by a time-inhomogeneous Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model. Within this model, we study a general set of equivalent martingale measures, and determine market reserves by applying these measures. In addition, we derive risk-minimizing strategies and mean-variance indifference prices and hedging strategies for the life insurance liabilities considered. Numerical examples are included, and the use of the stochastic mortality model is compared with deterministic models. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As people live longer, ages at death are becoming more similar. This dual advance over the last two centuries, a central aim of public health policies, is a major achievement of modern civilization. Some recent exceptions to the joint rise of life expectancy and life span equality, however, make it difficult to determine the underlying causes of this relationship. Here, we develop a unifying framework to study life expectancy and life span equality over time, relying on concepts about the pace and shape of aging. We study the dynamic relationship between life expectancy and life span equality with reliable data from the Human Mortality Database for 49 countries and regions with emphasis on the long time series from Sweden. Our results demonstrate that both changes in life expectancy and life span equality are weighted totals of rates of progress in reducing mortality. This finding holds for three different measures of the variability of life spans. The weights evolve over time and indicate the ages at which reductions in mortality increase life expectancy and life span equality: the more progress at the youngest ages, the tighter the relationship. The link between life expectancy and life span equality is especially strong when life expectancy is less than 70 y. In recent decades, life expectancy and life span equality have occasionally moved in opposite directions due to larger improvements in mortality at older ages or a slowdown in declines in midlife mortality. Saving lives at ages below life expectancy is the key to increasing both life expectancy and life span equality.},

Post retirement benefits are increasingly taken as a form of income benefit, either as a pension or an annuity. Pension funds and life insurers offer annuities generating long term liabilities linked to longevity. Risk management of life annuity portfolios for interest rate risks is well developed but the incorporation of longevity risk has received limited attention. We develop an immunization approach and a delta-gamma based hedging approach to manage the risks of adverse portfolio surplus using stochastic models for mortality and interest rates. We compare and assess the immunization and hedge effectiveness of fixed-income coupon bonds, annuity bonds, as well as longevity bonds, using simulations of the portfolio surplus for an annuity portfolio and a range of risk measures including value-at-risk. We show how fixed-income annuity bonds can more effectively match cash flows and provide additional hedge effectiveness over coupon bonds. Longevity bonds, including deferred longevity bonds, reduce risk significantly compared to coupon and annuity bonds, reflecting the long duration of the typical life annuity and the exposure to longevity risk. Longevity bonds are shown to be effective in immunizing surplus over short and long horizons. Delta gamma hedging is generally only effective over short horizons. The results of the paper have implications for how providers of post retirement income benefit streams can manage risks in demanding conditions where innovation in investment markets can support new products and increase the product range.},

abstract = {Policy in England and Wales has encouraged the concentration of hospital accident and emergency facilities into large units with substantial catchment areas. This means that many rural areas are considerable distances from the nearest hospital providing such services. Analysis of data on mortality from motor vehicle traffic accidents for males aged 15 to 24 reveals that death rates are substantially higher in rural areas than in the cities. It is shown that geographical variations in mortality rate are related to differences in the dependence on private transport, to the social composition of the population and to proximity to hospital accident and emergency facilities. This latter result suggests that policy-makers need to pay more attention to the accessibility of accident and emergency services. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {Who values life annuities more? Is it the healthy retiree who expects to live long and might become a centenarian, or is the unhealthy retiree with a short life expectancy more likely to appreciate the pooling of longevity risk? What if the unhealthy retiree is pooled with someone who is much healthier and forced to pay an implicit loading? To answer these and related questions this paper examines the empirical conditions under which retirees benefit (or may not) from longevity risk pooling by linking the economics of annuity equivalent wealth to actuarially models of aging. I focus attention on the Compensation Law of Mortality which implies that individuals with higher relative mortality (e.g., lower income) age more slowly and experience greater longevity uncertainty. Ergo, they place higher utility value on the annuity. The impetus for this research today is the increasing evidence on the growing disparity in longevity expectations between rich and poor.},

abstract = {Prolonging life expectancy and improving mortality rates is a common trend of the 21. st century. Stochastic models, such as Lee-Carter model (Lee and Carter, 1992), are a popular choice to deal with longevity risk. However, these mortality models often have unsatisfactory results for the case of small populations. Thus, quite a few modifications (such as approximation and maximal likelihood estimation) to the Lee-Carter can be used for the case of small populations or missing observations. In this study, we propose an alternative approach (graduation methods) to improve the performance of stochastic models.The proposed approach is a combination of data aggregation and mortality graduation. In specific, we first combine the historical data of target population, treating it as the reference population, and use the data graduation methods (Whittaker and partial standard mortality ratio) to stabilize the mortality estimates of the target population. We first evaluate whether the proposed method have smaller errors in mortality estimation than the Lee-Carter model in the case of small populations, and explore if it is possible to reduce the bias of parameter estimates in the Lee-Carter model. We found that the proposed approach can improve the model fit of the Lee-Carter model when the population size is 200,000 or less.},

Finally, the article examines the issue of whether high reported$\backslash$ntontine survival rates should be attributed to anti-selection or fraud.

Americans under age sixty-five during this period had elevated rates of amenable mortality compared to their peers in Europe. For Americans over age sixty-five, declines in amenable mortality slowed relative to their peers in Europe. Overall, amenable mortality rates among men from 1999 to 2007 fell by only 18.5 percent in the United States compared to 36.9 percent in the United Kingdom. Among women, the rates fell by 17.5 percent and 31.9 percent, respectively. Although US men and women had the lowest mortality from treatable cancers among the four countries, deaths from circulatory conditions—chiefly cerebrovascular disease and hypertension— were the main reason amenable death rates remained relatively high in the United States. These findings strengthen the case for reforms that will enable all Americans to receive timely and effective health care. 2114},

Our aim is to measure the impact of cause-of-death reduction on the whole population age structure, and more specifically on the dependency ratio which is a crucial quantity for pay-as-you-go pension systems. Although previous studies on causes of death focused on mortality indicators such as survival curves or life expectancy, our approach provides additional information by including birth patterns. As an important conclusion, our numerical results based on French data show that populations with identical life expectancies can present important differences in their age pyramid resulting from different cause-specific mortality reductions.

abstract = {? 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.This study develops a structural pricing model based on the Black 76 formula for the evaluation of the credit value adjustment (CVA) of OTC?traded caps and floors, which is mandated as an integral part of Basel III. The proposed structural pricing model improves the existing structural pricing models for vulnerable European options by allowing payments to be made after the exercise of the options. Five crucial determinants of caps? and floors? CVAs are identified by the proposed structural model, they are: the cap?s/floor?s tenor, the writer?s total asset value, the correlation between the cap?s/floor?s underlying and the writer?s total asset value, the volatility of the writer?s total asset value, and the writer?s aggregate liabilities. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effects of the crucial parameters. Compared to the market practice of CVA calculation based on reduced-form models, the five crucial parameters are the unique features of the proposed structural model.},

The proposed model adopts the approach of Heath, Jarrow and Morton's (1992) to obtain an analytical solution of European options on risky assets and futures contracts. Furthermore, this investigation develops upper bounds for American options prices using the proposed model. The upper bounds derived in this study are not only very tight and accurate for American option pricing, but can also enhance assessment and hedging efficiency in real world markets. The asset returns obtained by the proposed model are more closely match actual market phenomena presented in the option literature because the leptokurtic and asymmetric features, interest rates and volatility are stochastic over time.

The statistician can choose to work with well-defined freely varying parameters, derived as maximal invariants in this paper, or with ad hoc identified parameters which at first glance seem more intuitive, but which can introduce a number of unnecessary challenges. In this paper we describe the methodological advantages from using the maximal invariant parameterisation and we go through the extra methodological challenges a statistician has to deal with when insisting on working with ad hoc identifications. These challenges are broadly similar in frequentist and in Bayesian setups. We also go through a number of examples from the literature where ad hoc identifications have been preferred in the statistical analyses.},

abstract = {Credit risk has become a topical issue since the 2007 Credit Crisis, particularly for its impact on the valuation of OTC derivatives. This becomes critical when the credit risk of entities involved in a contract either as underlying or counterparty become highly correlated as is the case during macroeconomic shocks. It impacts the valuation of such contracts through an additional term, the credit valuation adjustment (CVA). This can become large with such correlation. This thesis outlines the main approaches to credit risk modelling, intensity and structural. It gives important examples of both and particular examples useful in the calculation of CVA, the intensity model of Brigo and the structural model of Hull and White. It details Brigo's market standard model independent framework for derivatives valuation with CVA. It does this for both its unilateral form where only one counterparty is credit risky and also for its bilateral form where both counterparties are credit risky. This thesis then shows how these frameworks can be applied to the valuation of a credit default swap contract (CDS). Finally, it shows how Brigo's and Hull and White's model for credit risk apply to the valuation of the CVA of CDS and draws comparisons, especially based on their ability to capture correlation effects.},

The general pricing rule when only one filtration is considered reveals to be non tractable in most of cases, whereas the second construction leads to much simplest formulas. Examples are given and evidence advanced that this set-up is more tractable.},

@article{Billari2014,
abstract = {This article suggests a procedure to derive stochastic population forecasts adopting an expert-based approach. As in previous work by Billari et al. (2012), experts are required to provide evaluations, in the form of conditional and unconditional scenarios, on summary indicators of the demographic components determining the population evolution: that is, fertility, mortality, and migration. Here, two main purposes are pursued. First, the demographic components are allowed to have some kind of dependence. Second, as a result of the existence of a body of shared information, possible correlations among experts are taken into account. In both cases, the dependence structure is not imposed by the researcher but rather is indirectly derived through the scenarios elicited from the experts. To address these issues, the method is based on a mixture model, within the so-called Supra-Bayesian approach, according to which expert evaluations are treated as data. The derived posterior distribution for the demographic indicators of interest is used as forecasting distribution, and a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is designed to approximate this posterior. This article provides the questionnaire designed by the authors to collect expert opinions. Finally, an application to the forecast of the Italian population from 2010 to 2065 is proposed.},

abstract = {The general health status of a population changes over time, generally in a positive direction. Some generations experience more unfavourable conditions than others. The health of Danish women in the interwar generations is an example of such a phenomenon. The stagnation in their life expectancy between 1977 and 1995 is thought to be related to their smoking behaviour. So far, no study has measured the absolute effect of smoking on the mortality of the interwar generations of Danish women and thus the stagnation in Danish women's life expectancy. We applied a method to estimate age-specific smoking-attributable number of deaths to examine the effect of smoking on the trends in partial life expectancy of Danish women between age 50 and 85 from 1950 to 2012. We compared these trends to those for women in Sweden, where there was no similar stagnation in life expectancy. When smoking-attributable mortality was excluded, the gap in partial life expectancy at age 50 between Swedish and Danish women diminished substantially. The effect was most pronounced in the interwar generations. The major reason for the stagnation in Danish women's partial life expectancy at age 50 was found to be smoking-related mortality in the interwar generations.},

abstract = {In models for vital rates which include effects due to age, period and cohort, there is aliasing due to a linear dependence among these three factors. This dependence arises both when age and period intervals are equal and when they are not. One solution to the dependence is to set an arbitrary constraint on the parameters. Estimable functions of the parameters are invariant to the particular constraint applied. For evenly spaced intervals, deviations from linearity are estimable but only a linear function of the three slopes is estimable. When age and period intervals have different widths, further aliasing occurs. It is assumed that the number of deaths in the numerator of the rate equation has a Poisson distribution. The calculations are illustrated with data on mortality from prostate cancer among nonwhites in the U.S.},

@article{Bijak2016,
abstract = {Bayesian statistics offers an alternative to classical (frequentist) statistics. It is distinguished by its use of probability distributions to describe uncertain quantities, which leads to elegant solutions to many difficult statistical problems. Although Bayesian demography, like Bayesian statistics more generally, is around 250 years old, only recently has it begun to flourish. The aim of this paper is to review the achievements of Bayesian demography, address some misconceptions, and make the case for wider use of Bayesian methods in population studies. We focus on three applications: demographic forecasts, limited data, and highly structured or complex models. The key advantages of Bayesian methods are the ability to integrate information from multiple sources and to describe uncertainty coherently. Bayesian methods also allow for including additional (prior) information next to the data sample. As such, Bayesian approaches are complementary to many traditional methods, which can be productively re-expressed in Bayesian terms.},

@article{GuzmanCastillo2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) remains a major cause of mortality in the United Kingdom. Yet predictions of future CHD mortality are potentially problematic due to population ageing and increase in obesity and diabetes. Here we explore future projections of CHD mortality in England {\&} Wales under two contrasting future trend assumptions.

METHODS: In scenario A, we used the conventional counterfactual scenario that the last-observed CHD mortality rates from 2011 would persist unchanged to 2030. The future number of deaths was calculated by applying those rates to the 2012-2030 population estimates. In scenario B, we assumed that the recent falling trend in CHD mortality rates would continue. Using Lee-Carter and Bayesian Age Period Cohort (BAPC) models, we projected the linear trends up to 2030. We validate our methods using past data to predict mortality from 2002-2011. Then, we computed the error between observed and projected values.

RESULTS: In scenario A, assuming that 2011 mortality rates stayed constant by 2030, the number of CHD deaths would increase 62{\%} or approximately 39,600 additional deaths. In scenario B, assuming recent declines continued, the BAPC model (the model with lowest error) suggests the number of deaths will decrease by 56{\%}, representing approximately 36,200 fewer deaths by 2030.

CONCLUSIONS: The decline in CHD mortality has been reasonably continuous since 1979, and there is little reason to believe it will soon halt. The commonly used assumption that mortality will remain constant from 2011 therefore appears slightly dubious. By contrast, using the BAPC model and assuming continuing mortality falls offers a more plausible prediction of future trends. Thus, despite population ageing, the number of CHD deaths might halve again between 2011 and 2030. This has implications for how the potential benefits of future cardiovascular strategies might best be calculated and presented.},

The upper bounds derived in this study are not only very tight and accurate for American option pricing, but can also enhance assessment and hedging efficiency in real world markets. The asset returns obtained by the proposed model are more closely match actual market phenomena presented in the option literature because the leptokurtic and asymmetric features, interest rates and volatility are stochastic over time.

These papers state an erroneous self-financing condition. In the first paper, this is equivalent to assuming that the equity position is self-financing on its own and without including the cash position. In the second paper, this is equivalent to assuming that a subportfolio is self-financing on its own, rather than the whole portfolio. The error in the first paper is avoided when clearly distinguishing between price processes, dividend processes and gain processes. We present an outline of the derivation that yields the correct statement of the self-financing condition, clarifying the structure of the relevant funding accounts, and show that the final result in "Funding beyond discounting" is correct, even if the self-financing condition stated is not.},

abstract = {Background: Mortality decreased in European Union (EU) countries during the last century. Despite these similar trends, there are still considerable differences in the levels of mortality between Eastern and Western European countries. Sub-group analysis of mortality in Europe for different age and sex groups is common, however to our knowledge a spatio-temporal methodology as in this study has not been applied to detect significant spatial dependence and interaction with time. Thus, the objective of this paper is to quantify the dynamics of mortality in Europe and detect significant clusters of mortality between European countries, applying spatio-temporal methodology. In addition, the joint evolution between the mortality of European countries and their neighbours over time was studied. Methods: The spatio-temporal methodology used in this study takes into account two factors: time and the geographical location of countries and, consequently, the neighbourhood relationships between them. This methodology was applied to 26 European countries for the period 1990-2012. Results: Principally, for people older than 64 years two significant clusters were obtained: one of high mortality formed by Eastern European countries and the other of low mortality composed of Western countries. In contrast, for ages below or equal to 64 years only the significant cluster of high mortality formed by Eastern European countries was observed. In addition, the joint evolution between the 26 European countries and their neighbours during the period 1990-2012 was confirmed. For this reason, it can be said that mortality in EU not only depends on differences in the health systems, which are a subject to national discretion, but also on supra-national developments. Conclusions: This paper proposes statistical tools which provide a clear framework for the successful implementation of development public policies to help the UE meet the challenge of rethinking its social model (Social Security and health care) and make it sustainable in the medium term.},

abstract = {Basis risk is an important consideration when hedging longevity risk with instruments based on longevity indices, since the longevity experience of the hedged exposure may differ from that of the index.

The framework is founded on an analysis of historical experience data, together with an appreciation of the contextual relationship between the two related populations in social, economic and demographic terms. Despite the different demographic profiles, the case study provides evidence of stable long-term relationships between the mortality experiences of the two populations. This suggests the important result that high levels of hedge effectiveness should be achievable with appropriatelycalibrated, $\backslash$nstatic, index-based longevity hedges. Indeed, this is borne out in detailed calculations of hedge effectiveness for a hypothetical pension portfolio where the basis risk is based on the case study. A robustness check involving populations from the US yields similar results.},

While in most countries this accumulated capital (called survivor dividend, SD) is kept by the scheme, in Sweden it is distributed among the same cohort survivors. This paper aims to analyse to what extend the SD kept by most NDCs can be used to cover an unexpected longevity increase. We develop formulae under different assumptions (constant or according to Lee-Carter mortality improvements) to calculate the maximum mortality decrease a scheme can cover if the SD is not distributed. We also apply the formulae using Polish, Latvian and Swedish life tables and show that the non-distribution of the SD is a potential solution to cover the longevity risk of NDCs.},

Relative to the ordinary kernel density estimator, this technique performs much better when a parametric vehicle distribution fits the data, and otherwise performs at broadly the same level. Jones, Linton and Nielsen (1995) present a somewhat similar method for density estimation which has higher order bias for all sufficiently smooth densities. In this paper, we combine the two methods. We show that, theoretically, the desired properties of general higher order bias allied with even better performance for an appropriate vehicle model are achieved. Simulations suggest that the new estimator realises only a little of its theoretical potential in practice for small to moderately large sample sizes.

abstract = {Life annuities and pension products usually involve a number of guarantees, such as minimum accumulation rates, minimum annual payments or a minimum total payout. Packaging different types of guarantees is the feature of so-called variable annuities. Basically, these products are unit-linked investment policies providing a post-retirement income. The guarantees, commonly referred to as GMxBs (namely, Guaranteed Minimum Benefits of type 'x'), include minimum benefits both in the case of death and survival. In this paper we propose a unifying framework for the valuation of variable annuities under quite general model assumptions. We compute and compare contract values and fair fee rates under 'static' and 'mixed' valuation approaches, via ordinary and least squares Monte Carlo methods, espectively. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background Health outcomes are known to vary at both the country and local levels, but trends in mortality across a detailed and comprehensive set of causes have not been previously described at a very local level. Life expectancy in King County, WA, USA, is in the 95th percentile among all counties in the USA. However, little is known about how life expectancy and mortality from different causes of death vary at a local, neighbourhood level within this county. In this analysis, we estimated life expectancy and cause-specific mortality within King County to describe spatial trends, quantify disparities in mortality, and assess the contribution of each cause of death to overall disparities in all-cause mortality. Methods We applied established so-called garbage code redistribution algorithms and small area estimation methods to death registration data for King County to estimate life expectancy, cause-specific mortality rates, and years of life lost (YLL) rates from 152 causes of death for 397 census tracts from Jan 1, 1990, to Dec 31, 2014. We used the cause list developed for the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study for this analysis. Deaths were tabulated by age group, sex, census tract, and cause of death. We used Bayesian mixed-effects regression models to estimate mortality overall and from each cause. Findings Between 1990 and 2014, life expectancy in King County increased by 5{\textperiodcentered}4 years (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 5{\textperiodcentered}0–5{\textperiodcentered}7) among men (from 74{\textperiodcentered}0 years [73{\textperiodcentered}7–74{\textperiodcentered}3] to 79{\textperiodcentered}3 years [79{\textperiodcentered}1–79{\textperiodcentered}6]) and by 3{\textperiodcentered}4 years (3{\textperiodcentered}0–3{\textperiodcentered}7) among women (from 80{\textperiodcentered}0 years [79{\textperiodcentered}7–80{\textperiodcentered}2] to 83{\textperiodcentered}3 years [83{\textperiodcentered}1–83{\textperiodcentered}5]). In 2014, life expectancy ranged from 68{\textperiodcentered}4 years (95{\%} UI 66{\textperiodcentered}9–70{\textperiodcentered}1) to 86{\textperiodcentered}7 years (85{\textperiodcentered}0–88{\textperiodcentered}2) for men and from 73{\textperiodcentered}6 years (71{\textperiodcentered}6–75{\textperiodcentered}5) to 88{\textperiodcentered}4 years (86{\textperiodcentered}9–89{\textperiodcentered}9) for women among census tracts within King County. Rates of YLL by cause also varied substantially among census tracts for each cause of death. Geographical areas with relatively high and relatively low YLL rates differed by cause. In general, causes of death responsible for more YLLs overall also contributed more significantly to geographical inequality within King County. However, certain causes contributed more to inequality than to overall YLLs. Interpretation This census tract-level analysis of life expectancy and cause-specific YLL rates highlights important differences in health among neighbourhoods in King County that are masked by county-level estimates. Efforts to improve population health in King County should focus on reducing geographical inequality, by targeting those health conditions that contribute the most to overall YLLs and to inequality. This analysis should be replicated in other locations to more fully describe fine-grained local-level variation in population health and contribute to efforts to improve health while reducing inequalities.

abstract = {The basic compartmental models for disease transmission are extended to include three separate biological features. The first such feature is vertical transmission of disease, for which two ordinary differential equation models (SIR and SEIR) are formulated and analyzed. In particular, vertical transmission is shown to increase the basic reproduction number. Immigration of infective individuals is considered as a second feature, and the resulting model has a unique endemic equilibrium (with no disease-free state). An illustration is provided that includes screening and isolating infectives to reduce the spread of disease. A constant period of temporary immunity is introduced in an SIRS model as the third feature. This results in an integrodifferential equation for the fraction of infectives. Analysis shows that, for some parameter values, Hopf bifurcation can give rise to periodic solutions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Three different analysis platforms using LC-MS were successfully developed for pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of an antibody drug in serum. These analysis platforms can be selectively used for different types of protein drugs, which ranged from a very specific for a particular drug (antibody enrichment) to a less specific for any antibody drugs with an Fc domain (protein A enrichment), and to a very generic method that can be used for any protein drugs (albumin depletion method). In this manner, the three platforms will be applicable to a wide range of antibody therapeutic studies for different species. The analysis using an albumin depletion method (with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)) achieved the detection of the drug (to 1 ng) in an aliquot of serum (30 microL) with a 5-order magnitude of linearity. The analysis using protein A enrichment (with SDS-PAGE) achieved the detection of the drug at a 50-fold lower level (to 0.02 ng). Without the use of SDS-PAGE for separation, the use of protein A enrichment achieved the detection to 10 ng and using the antidrug antibody enrichment achieved the detection to 0.1 ng, with a similar linear dynamic range. These three analysis platforms produced good agreement with a mimic PK study of the drug in monkey serum, as compared to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) approach. In addition, these analysis platforms can be selectively applied for PK studies of drugs with different requirements of development time and resources. Such as, the antibody enrichment method can be used in a high-throughput manner but limited to a specific protein drug only. On the other hand, the albumin depletion method can be applied to many types of protein drugs but with the laborious sample preparation steps (SDS-PAGE and the subsequent in-gel digestion). When antidrug antibodies are not available for antibody drugs or the sensitivity requirement is not stringent (e.g., {\textgreater}10 ng), using protein A enrichment (without using SDS-PAGE) seems to be a good choice for PK studies which require fast throughput.},

In Part 3A, we developed certain properties for both these types of stochastic bridge, and we investigate the properties of many of our data series on the same lines. We have several economic or investment series, which all have their own peculiarities. In this paper, we cover only retail prices and wages. The other series are dealt with in Part 3C. We find that, although the annual series for the rate of inflation is generated by an AR(1) model, which is the discrete time equivalent of an OU process, an OU bridge is not suitable. We need to use a Brownian bridge on the logarithm of the Price Index. Further, the standard deviation of the monthly increments in any year is, as we find empirically from the data, a function of the change in the annual value, and further there is correlation between the monthly increments in successive years.},

Shrinking a large complex model in order to simplify it typically involves two processes: aggregation and decomposition. Both processes are known to introduce biases into the resulting representations of population dynamics. Thus it is difficult to accept the conclusion that simple models outperform complex models. Moreover, assessments of forecasting performance are notoriously difficult to carry out, because they inevitably depend not only on the models used but also on the particular historical periods selected for examination.... This paper reviews some of the recent debate on the simple versus complex modeling issue and links it to the questions of model bias and distributional momentum impacts." (SUMMARY IN FRE)},

Yet how these between-group differences relate to the total variation in mortality risk between individuals is unknown.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used data assembled and harmonized as part of the Eurothine project, which includes census-based mortality data from 11 European countries. We matched this to national data from the Human Mortality Database and constructed life tables by gender and educational level. We measured variation in age at death using Theil's entropy index, and decomposed this measure into its between- and within-group components.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The least-educated groups lived between three and 15 years fewer than the highest-educated groups, the latter having a more similar age at death in all countries. Differences between educational groups contributed between 0.6{\%} and 2.7{\%} to total variation in age at death between individuals in Western European countries and between 1.2{\%} and 10.9{\%} in Central and Eastern European countries. Variation in age at death is larger and differs more between countries among the least-educated groups.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: At the individual level, many known and unknown factors are causing enormous variation in age at death, socioeconomic position being only one of them. Reducing variations in age at death among less-educated people by providing protection to the vulnerable may help to reduce inequalities in mortality between socioeconomic groups.},

@article{Leung2018,
abstract = {The presence of systematic risk in mortality forecasts, known as longevity risk, has called for the introduction of longevity instruments and their market development. Management of longevity risk has been an ongoing issue for insurance companies and pension funds who offer products with payout depending on the lifetime of policyholders. One of the major difficulties in pricing longevity instruments is the determination of a longevity risk-premium. This problem arises from the fact that the longevity market is illiquid and is considered to be incomplete. In this paper we provide an insight to the study of several pricing approaches for longevity instruments that have been proposed in the literature. To account for parameter uncertainty in mortality forecasts and longevity instruments pricing, our analysis hinges on a Bayesian state-space mortality model. The sampling-based Bayesian approach allows us to obtain a distribution of the longevity risk-premium, thus providing an alternative perspective in analyzing the pricing methods. We also discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the considered pricing approaches.},

@article{Herman2014,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Recently, much media attention has been given to the premature deaths in professional wrestlers. Since no formal studies exist that have statistically examined the probability of premature mortality in professional wrestlers, we determined survival estimates for active wresters over the past quarter century to establish the factors contributing to the premature mortality of these individuals. METHODS: Data including cause of death was obtained from public records and wrestling publications in wrestlers who were active between January 1, 1985 and December 31, 2011. 557 males were considered consistently active wrestlers during this time period. 2007 published mortality rates from the Center for Disease Control were used to compare the general population to the wrestlers by age, BMI, time period, and cause of death. Survival estimates and Cox hazard regression models were fit to determine incident premature deaths and factors associated with lower survival. Cumulative incidence function (CIF) estimates given years wrestled was obtained using a competing risks model for cause of death. RESULTS: The mortality for all wrestlers over the 26-year study period was.007 deaths/total person-years or 708 per 100,000 per year, and 16{\%} of deaths occurred below age 50 years. Among wrestlers, the leading cause of deaths based on CIF was cardiovascular-related (38{\%}). For cardiovascular-related deaths, drug overdose-related deaths and cancer deaths, wrestler mortality rates were respectively 15.1, 122.7 and 6.4 times greater than those of males in the general population. Survival estimates from hazard models indicated that BMI is significantly associated with the hazard of death from total time wrestling (p{\textless}0.0001). CONCLUSION: Professional wrestlers are more likely to die prematurely from cardiovascular disease compared to the general population and morbidly obese wrestlers are especially at risk. Results from this study may be useful for professional wrestlers, as well as wellness policy and medical care implementation.},

Our approach respects the basic economic requirement that LIBOR rates are non-negative, and the basic requirement from mathematical finance that LIBOR rates are analytically tractable martingales with respect to their own forward measure. Additionally, and most importantly, our approach also leads to analytically tractable expressions of multi-LIBOR payoffs. This approach unifies therefore the advantages of well-known forward price models with those of classical LIBOR rate models. Several examples are added and prototypical volatility smiles are shown. We believe that the CIR-process based LIBOR model might be of particular interest for applications, since closed form valuation formulas for caps and swaptions are derived.},

abstract = {International migration is one of the major determinants of demographic change. Although efforts to produce comparable statistics are underway, estimates of demographic flows are inexistent, outdated, or largely inconsistent, for most countries. We estimate age and gender-specific migration rates using data extracted from a large sample of Yahoo! e-mail messages. Self-reported age and gender of anonymized e-mail users were linked to the geographic locations (mapped from IP addresses) from where users sent e-mail messages over time (2009-2011). The users' country of residence over time was inferred as the one from where most e-mail messages were sent. Our estimates of age profiles of migration are qualitatively consistent with existing administrative data sources. Selection bias generates uncertainty for estimates at one point in time, especially for developing countries. However, our approach allows us to compare in a reliable way migration trends of females and males. We document the recent increase in human mobility and we observe that female mobility has been increasing at a faster pace. Our findings suggest that e-mail data may complement existing migration data, resolve inconsistencies arising from different definitions of migration, and provide new and rich information on mobility patterns and social networks of migrants. The use of digital records for demographic research has the potential to become particularly important for developing countries, where the diffusion of Internet will be faster than the development of mature demographic registration systems},

abstract = {Mortality forecasting has received increasing interest during recent decades due to the negative financial effects of continuous longevity improvements on public and private institutions' liabilities. However, little attention has been paid to forecasting mortality from a cohort perspective. In this article, we introduce a novel methodology to forecast adult cohort mortality from age-at-death distributions. We propose a relational model that associates a time-invariant standard to a series of fully and partially observed distributions. Relation is achieved via a transformation of the age-axis. We show that cohort forecasts can improve our understanding of mortality developments by capturing distinct cohort effects, which might be overlooked by a conventional age–period perspective. Moreover, mortality experiences of partially observed cohorts are routinely completed. We illustrate our methodology on adult female mortality for cohorts born between 1835 and 1970 in two high-longevity countries using data from the Human Mortality Database.},

@article{Yadav2018,
abstract = {In real world data are often plagued by missing values which adversely affects the final outcome of the analysis based on such data. The missing values can be handled using various techniques like deletion or imputation. Of late, R has become one of the most preferred platform for carrying out data analysis, and its popularity is growing further. R provides various packages for handling missing values through imputation. The presence of multiple packages however, calls for an analysis of their comparative performance and examine their suitability for handling a given set of data. The performance of different R packages may differ for different datasets and may depend on the size of the dataset and richness of the missing values in the datasets. In this paper, the authors perform comparative study of the performance of the common R packages, namely VIM, MICE, MissForest, and HMISC, used for missing value imputation. The authors measured the performances of the said packages in terms of their imputation time, imputation efficiency and the effect on the variance. The imputation efficiency was measured in terms of the difference in predictive performance of a model built using original dataset vis-{\`{a}}-vis a dataset with imputed values. Similarly, the variance of the variables in the original dataset was compared that of corresponding variables in the imputed dataset. A missing value imputation package can be considered to be better if it consumes less imputation time and provides high imputation accuracy. Also in terms of variance, one would like to have the imputation package maintain the original variance of the variables. On analysing the four imputation packages on two datasets over three predictive algorithms–Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks–it was observed that the performances varies depending on the size of the dataset, and the missing values present in them. The study highlights that certain missing value package used in conjunction with a given predictive algorithm provides better performance, which is again a function of the dataset characteristics.},

Probabilistic forecasting aims to maximize the sharpness of the predictive distributions, subject to calibration, on the basis of the available information set. We formalize and study notions of calibration in a prediction space setting. In practice, probabilistic calibration can be checked by examining probability integral transform (PIT) histograms. Proper scoring rules such as the logarithmic score and the continuous ranked probability score serve to assess calibration and sharpness simultaneously. As a special case, consistent scoring functions provide decision-theoretically coherent tools for evaluating point forecasts. We emphasize methodological links to parametric and nonparametric distributional regression techniques, which attempt to model and to estimate conditional distribution functions; we use the context of statistically postprocessed ensemble forecasts in numerical weather prediction as an example. Throughout, we illustrate concepts and methodologies in data examples.},

We evaluate the contracts' appeal with respect to the retiree's welfare, and the viability of the market solution through the financial reward to the annuity provider's equityholders. The collective agreement yields marginally higher individual welfare than an annuity contract priced at its best estimate. Under realistic capital provision hypotheses, the annuity provider is incapable of adequately compensating its equityholders for bearing longevity risk. Individuals find it more attractive to bear longevity risk under a collective arrangement than to insure it with a life insurers'annuity contract subject to insolvency risk (albeit small).},

This research outlines and investigates the Stacking Multi-Learning Ensemble (SMLE) model for time series prediction problem over various horizons with a focus on the forecasts accuracy, directions hit-rate, and the average growth rate of total oil demand. This investigation presents a flexible ensemble framework in light of blend heterogeneous models for demonstrating and forecasting nonlinear time series. The proposed SMLE model combines support vector regression (SVR), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and linear regression (LR) learners, the ensemble architecture consists of four phases: generation, pruning, integration, and ensemble prediction task. We have conducted an empirical study to evaluate and compare the performance of SMLE using Global Oil Consumption (GOC). Thus, the assessment of the proposed model was conducted at single and multistep horizon prediction using unique benchmark techniques. The final results reveal that the proposed SMLE model outperforms all the other benchmark methods listed in this study at various levels such as error rate, similarity, and directional accuracy by 0.74{\%}, 0.020{\%}, and 91.24{\%}, respectively. Therefore, this study demonstrates that the ensemble model is an extremely encouraging methodology for complex time series forecasting.},

abstract = {Previous research has revealed much global convergence over the past several decades in life expectancy at birth and in infant mortality, which are closely linked. But trends in the variance of length of life, and in the variance of length of adult life in particular, are less well understood. I examine life-span inequality in a comprehensive panel of 180 countries observed in 1970 and 2000. Convergence in infant mortality has unambiguously reduced world inequality in total length of life starting from birth, but world inequality in length of adult life has remained largely unchanged. underlying both of these observations is a growing share of total inequality attributable to between-country variation. Especially among developed countries, the absolute level of between-country inequality has risen over time. The sources of widening inequality in length of life between countries remain unclear, but signs point away from changes in income, leaving patterns of knowledge diffusion as a likely candidate. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Population Council, Inc.},

abstract = {The curse of dimensionality problem arises when a limited number of observations are used to estimate a high-dimensional frontier, in particular, by data envelopment analysis (DEA). The study conducts a data generating process (DGP) to argue the typical “rule of thumb” used in DEA, e.g. the required number of observations should be at least larger than twice of the number of inputs and outputs, is ambiguous and will produce large deviations in estimating the technical efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) variable selection technique, which is usually used in data science for extracting significant factors, and combine it in a sign-constrained convex nonparametric least squares (SCNLS), which can be regarded as DEA estimator. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LASSO-SCNLS method and its variants provide useful guidelines for the DEA with small datasets.},

@article{Harper2015,
abstract = {Investigations of age, period, and cohort effects are difficult because the 3 factors are linearly dependent. In a novel application, Kramer et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2015;182(4):302-312) have used graphical analysis and statistical models to estimate the impact that age, period, and cohort effects have had on trends in black-white inequalities in heart disease mortality. Using a constrained regression approach (with the first 2 periods' effects constrained to zero), Kramer et al. find evidence that age and cohort effects figure more prominently than do period effects in contributing to relative black-white mortality differences, and they argue that early-life exposures should be given greater consideration for mitigation of racial differences in heart disease. In this invited commentary, I argue that the utility of age-period-cohort models for understanding health inequalities depends on the plausibility of the assumptions used to break the link between the 3 factors. Based on the existing age-period-cohort literature, alternative assumptions seem likely to produce substantially different results. I also argue that interpretations of the impacts of age, period, and cohort effects on racial inequalities in heart disease mortality may depend on whether inequalities are assessed on the absolute scale or the relative scale.},

abstract = {This report responds to the objective in the Inquiry's Terms of Reference to best position Australia's financial system to meet Australia's evolving needs and support economic growth. It offers a blueprint for an efficient and resilient financial system over the next 10 to 20 years, characterised by the fair treatment of users. The Inquiry has made 44 recommendations relating to the Australian financial system. These recommendations reflect the Inquiry's judgement and are based on evidence received by the Inquiry. The Inquiry's test has been one of public interest: the interests of individuals, businesses, the economy, taxpayers and Government. Australia's financial system has performed well since the Wallis Inquiry and has many strong characteristics. It also has a number of weaknesses: taxation and regulatory settings distort the flow of funding to the real economy; it remains susceptible to financial shocks; superannuation is not delivering retirement incomes efficiently; unfair consumer outcomes remain prevalent; and policy settings do not focus on the benefits of competition and innovation. As a result, the system is prone to calls for more regulation. To put these issues in context, the Overview first deals with the characteristics of Australia's economy. It then describes the characteristics of and prerequisites for a well-functioning financial system and the Inquiry's philosophy of financial regulation. The Inquiry focuses on seven themes in this report (summarised in Guide to the Financial System Inquiry Final Report). The Overview deals with the general themes of funding the Australian economy and competition. The Inquiry has also made recommendations on five specific themes, which comprise the next chapters of this report: * Strengthen the economy by making the financial system more resilient. * Lift the value of the superannuation system and retirement incomes. * Drive economic growth and productivity through settings that promote innovation * Enhance confidence and trust by creating an environment in which financial firms treat customers fairly. * Enhance regulator independence and accountability, and minimise the need for future regulation. These recommendations seek to improve efficiency, resilience and fair treatment in the Australian financial system, allowing it to achieve its potential in supporting economic growth and enhancing standards of living for current and future generations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose AR-GARCH (autoregression-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) models to fit and forecast mortality rates for a given age by two alternative approaches. Specifically, one approach is to fit a time series of mortality rates for some age to an AR(n)-GARCH(1, 1) model, and project the mortality rate for that age in the next nth year; the other is to fit an AR(1)-GARCH(1, 1) model, and project the mortality rates recursively for the age in the next consecutive years. Further, we employ the copula method to capture the inter-age mortality dependence. Adopting mortality data of Japan, the UK, and the USA, we demonstrate that it is indispensable to consider the conditional heteroskedasticity in our mortality models which provide better performances in out-of-sample projection and prediction intervals with a higher degree of coverage than the Lee-Carter model. Finally, we numerically illustrate with mortality data of Japan that VaR (Value at Risk) values for longevity risk, regarded as additional reserves for annuity or pension providers, will be overestimated if the conditional heteroskedasticity or/and the inter-age mortality dependence structure are ignored.},

Often, variables possess a grouping structure, and the relevant selection problem is that of selecting groups, not individual variables. The group lasso has been proposed as a way of extending the ideas of the lasso to the problem of group selection. Nonconvex penalties such as SCAD and MCP have been proposed and shown to have several advantages over the lasso; these penalties may also be extended to the group selection problem, giving rise to group SCAD and group MCP methods. Here, we describe algorithms for fitting these models stably and efficiently. In addition, we present simulation results and real data examples comparing and contrasting the statistical properties of these methods.},

abstract = {Background: The adverse association between income, health and survival is well documented, but little is known about how income trajectories influence health and survival for men and women. We aim to investigate sex differences in mortality and hospitalisations by income and income changes. Methods: We performed a population-based, nationwide study including 1 063 787 Danes born 1935-1955 and residing in Denmark during 1980-2015. Income was calculated during two age intervals: 45-49 and 55-59 years. The average income was divided into quartiles for men and women separately, which formed the basis for the income trajectories. Individuals were followed up from age 60 until 2014/2015 for hospital admission and mortality, respectively. Results: Men had higher mortality and were more hospitalised than women. Sex differences in mortality were most pronounced for people with stable low income (relative difference in hazard=1.93; 95{\%} CI 1.89 to 1.98) and a downward income trajectory (1.91; 95{\%} CI 1.85 to 1.98) with smaller sex differences for people with an upward trajectory (1.59; 95{\%} CI 1.56 to 1.62) and stable high income (1.37; 95{\%} CI 1.33 to 1.41). A similar pattern was found for family income. Regarding hospitalisations, similar results were found, though less pronounced. Investigation of mortality and hospitalisations by all possible trajectories demonstrated that income at ages 55-59 was an important predictor of mortality, with increasing mortality for decreasing income quartile. Conclusion: Income trajectories as a proxy for change in social position have a larger influence on men's than women's health and mortality. Income in the late 50s is an important predictor of mortality, particularly for men.},

This is because these estimates fail to take into account the fact that those who are saved from the cause are likely to have one or more other conditions ("competing" causes of death), which may increase their risks of dying. It is unknown to what extent this introduces bias in comparisons of life years to be gained between underlying causes of death. The purpose of the study was to assess this bias.},

abstract = {Importance Examining life expectancy by county allows for tracking geographic disparities over time and assessing factors related to these disparities. This information is potentially useful for policy makers, clinicians, and researchers seeking to reduce disparities and increase longevity. Objective To estimate annual life tables by county from 1980 to 2014; describe trends in geographic inequalities in life expectancy and age-specific risk of death; and assess the proportion of variation in life expectancy explained by variation in socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Design, Setting, and Participants Annual county-level life tables were constructed using small area estimation methods from deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and population counts from the US Census Bureau, NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database. Measures of geographic inequality in life expectancy and age-specific mortality risk were calculated. Principal component analysis and ordinary least squares regression were used to examine the county-level association between life expectancy and socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Exposures County of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures Life expectancy at birth and age-specific mortality risk. Results Counties were combined as needed to create stable units of analysis over the period 1980 to 2014, reducing the number of areas analyzed from 3142 to 3110. In 2014, life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 79.1 (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI], 79.0-79.1) years overall, but differed by 20.1 (95{\%} UI, 19.1-21.3) years between the counties with the lowest and highest life expectancy. Absolute geographic inequality in life expectancy increased between 1980 and 2014. Over the same period, absolute geographic inequality in the risk of death decreased among children and adolescents, but increased among older adults. Socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors explained 60{\%}, 74{\%}, and 27{\%} of county-level variation in life expectancy, respectively. Combined, these factors explained 74{\%} of this variation. Most of the association between socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors and life expectancy was mediated through behavioral and metabolic risk factors. Conclusions and Relevance Geographic disparities in life expectancy among US counties are large and increasing. Much of the variation in life expectancy among counties can be explained by a combination of socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Policy action targeting socioeconomic factors and behavioral and metabolic risk factors may help reverse the trend of increasing disparities in life expectancy in the United States.},

Differences in variance exacerbate health inequalities between and among rich and poor countries. Accounting for the cost of life-span variance appears to amplify recently discovered patterns of convergence in world average human well-being because the component of variance due to infant mortality has exhibited even more convergence than life expectancy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Many mortality forecasting approaches extrapolate past trends. Their predictions of the future development can be quite precise as long as turning points and/or age-shifts of mortality decline are not present. To account even for such mortality dynamics, we propose a model that combines recently developed ideas in a single framework. It (1) uses rates of mortality improvement to model the aging of mortality decline, and it (2) optionally combines the mortality trends of multiple countries to catch anticipated turning points. We use simulation-based Bayesian inference to estimate and run this model that also provides prediction intervals to quantify forecast uncertainty. Validating mortality forecasts for British and Danish women from 1991 to 2011 suggest that our model can forecast regular and irregular mortality developments and that it can perform at least as well as other widely accepted approaches like, for instance, the Lee-Carter model or the UN Bayesian approach. Moreover, prospective mortality forecasts from 2012 to 2050 suggest gradual increases for British and Danish life expectancy at birth.},

abstract = {We solve a retirement lifecycle model in which the consumer's age does not move in lockstep with calendar time. Instead, biological age increases at a stochastic non- linear rate in chronological age, which one can think of as working with a clock that occasionally moves backwards in time. Our paper is inspired by the growing body of medical literature that has identified biomarkers of aging which – practically speaking – offer better estimates of expected remaining lifetime and future mortality rates. It isn't farfetched to argue that in the not-too-distant future of wearable technology, personal age will be more closely associated with biological time vs. calendar age or time. Thus, after introducing our stochastic mortality model we derive optimal consumption rates in a classic Yaari (1965) framework adjusted to our proper clock and time. In addition to the normative implications of having access to biological age, our positive objective is to partially explain the cross-sectional heterogeneity in retirement spending rates at any given chronological age. In sum, we argue that biological age is not a sufficient statistic for making economic decisions and you need information about both your ages to behave rationally.},

In this paper, we develop a new flexible approach to modelling health transitions in a multi-state Markov model that allows for age effects, time trends and age-time interactions. The model is implemented in the generalised linear modelling framework. We apply the model to evaluate health transitions of Chinese elderly using individual-level panel data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey for the period 1998–2012. Our results confirm that time trends and age–time interactions are important factors explaining health transitions in addition to the more commonly used age effects. We document that differences in disability and mortality rates continue to persist between urban and rural older Chinese. We also compute life expectancies and healthy life expectancies based on the proposed model as inputs for the development of aged care and financial services for older Chinese.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, mortality was considerably higher in the former East Germany than in West Germany. The gap narrowed rapidly after German reunification. The convergence was particularly strong for women, to the point that Eastern women aged 50–69 now have lower mortality despite lower incomes and worse overall living conditions. Prior research has shown that lower smoking rates among East German female cohorts born in the 1940s and 1950s were a major contributor to this crossover. However, after 1990, smoking behavior changed dramat-ically, with higher smoking intensity observed among women in the eastern part of Germany. We forecast the impact of this changing smoking behavior on East-West mortality differences and find that the higher smoking rates among younger East German cohorts will reverse their contemporary mortality advantage. Mortality fore-casting methods that do not account for smoking would, perhaps misleadingly, forecast a growing mortality advantage for East German women. Experience from other countries shows that smoking can be effectively reduced by strict anti-smoking poli-cies. Instead, East Germany is becoming an example warning of the consequences of weakening anti-smoking policies and changing behavioral norms.},

abstract = {The paper derives a general form of the term structure of interest rates. The following assumptions are made: (A.1) The instantaneous (spot) interest rate follows a diffusion process; (A.2) the price of a discount bond depends only on the spot rate over its term; and (A.3) the market is efficient. Under these assumptions, it is shown by means of an arbitrage argument that the expected rate of return on any bond in excess of the spot rate is proportional to its standard deviation. This property is then used to derive a partial differential equation for bond prices. The solution to that equation is given in the form of a stochastic integral representation. An interpretation of the bond pricing formula is provided. The model is illustrated on a specific case. {\textcopyright} 1977.},

@article{Alvarez2019,
abstract = {It is uncertain whether Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) countries are approaching a single mortality regime. Over the last three decades, LAC has experienced major public health interventions and the highest number of homicides in the world. However, these interventions and homicide rates are not evenly shared across countries. This study documents trends in life expectancy and lifespan variability for 20 LAC countries, 2000–14. By extending a previous method, we decompose differences in lifespan variability between LAC and a developed world benchmark into cause-specific effects. For both sexes, dispersion of amenable diseases through the age span makes the largest contribution to the gap between LAC and the benchmark. Additionally, for males, the concentration of homicides, accidents, and suicides in mid-life further impedes mortality convergence. Great disparity exists in the region: while some countries are rapidly approaching the developed regime, others remain far behind and suffer a clear disadvantage in population health.},

abstract = {The curse of dimensionality problem arises when a limited number of observations are used to estimate a high-dimensional frontier, in particular, by data envelopment analysis (DEA). The study conducts a data generating process (DGP) to argue the typical “rule of thumb” used in DEA, e.g. the required number of observations should be at least larger than twice of the number of inputs and outputs, is ambiguous and will produce large deviations in estimating the technical efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) variable selection technique, which is usually used in data science for extracting significant factors, and combine it in a sign-constrained convex nonparametric least squares (SCNLS), which can be regarded as DEA estimator. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LASSO-SCNLS method and its variants provide useful guidelines for the DEA with small datasets.},

We also construct risk measures using vine-copula simulations, which take into account the dependence between the idiosyncratic components of the mortality rates.

abstract = {Background: Access to health facilities remains limited in many resource-poor settings, and women and their children often have to travel far to seek care. However, data on distance are scarce, and it is unclear whether distance is associated with worse child health outcomes. We estimate the relationships between distance to facility, service utilization and child mortality in low-and middle-income countries. Methods: Population-representative data are pooled from 29 demographic and health surveys across 21 low-and middle-income countries. Multivariable logistic models and meta-analysis regressions are used to estimate associations between facility distance, child mortality, and health care utilization in the pooled sample as well as for each survey. Results: Compared with children who live within 1 km of a facility, children living within 2 km, 3 km, and 5 km of a facility have a 7.7{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.927-1.251], 16.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.020-1.327) and 25{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.087-1.439) higher odds of neonatal mortality, respectively; children living farther than 10 km have a 26.6{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.108-1.445) higher odds of neonatal mortality. Women living farther than 10 km from a facility have a 55.3{\%} lower odds of in-facility delivery compared with women who live within 1 km [odds ratio (OR): 0.447; 95{\%} CI: 0.394-0.508]. Conclusions: Even relatively small distances from health facilities are associated with substantial mortality penalties for children. Policies that reduce travel distances and travel times are likely to increase utilization of health services and reduce neonatal mortality.},

abstract = {Probabilistic forecasts of continuous variables take the form of predictive densities or predictive cumulative distribution functions. We propose a diagnostic approach to the evalu-ation of predictive performance that is based on the paradigm of maximizing the sharpness of the predictive distributions subject to calibration. Calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the distributional forecasts and the observations and is a joint property of the predic-tions and the events that materialize. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions and is a property of the forecasts only. A simple theoretical framework allows us to distinguish between probabilistic calibration, exceedance calibration and marginal calibration. We propose and study tools for checking calibration and sharpness, among them the probabil-ity integral transform histogram, marginal calibration plots, the sharpness diagram and proper scoring rules. The diagnostic approach is illustrated by an assessment and ranking of probab-ilistic forecasts of wind speed at the Stateline wind energy centre in the US Pacific Northwest. In combination with cross-validation or in the time series context, our proposal provides very general, nonparametric alternatives to the use of information criteria for model diagnostics and model selection.},

abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used in data processing and dimensionality reduction. However, PCA suffers from the fact that each principal component is a linear combination of all the original variables, thus it is often difficult to interpret the results. We introduce a new method called sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) using the lasso (elastic net) to produce modified principal components with sparse loadings. We first show that PCA can be formulated as a regression-type optimization problem; sparse loadings are then obtained by imposing the lasso (elastic net) constraint on the regression coefficients. Efficient algorithms are proposed to fit our SPCA models for both regular multivariate data and gene expression arrays. We also give a new formula to compute the total variance of modified principal components. As illustrations, SPCA is applied to real and simulated data with encouraging results.},

@article{Shang2012,
abstract = {Background: Any improvement in the forecast accuracy of life expectancy would be beneficial for policy decision regarding the allocation of current and future resources. In this paper, I revisit some methods for forecasting age-specific life expectancies. Objective: This paper proposes a model averaging approach to produce accurate point forecasts of age-specific life expectancies. Methods: Illustrated by data from fourteen developed countries, we compare point and interval forecasts among ten principal component methods, two random walk methods, and two univariate time-series methods. Results: Based on averaged one-step-ahead and ten-step-ahead forecast errors, random walk with drift and Lee-Miller methods are the two most accurate methods for producing point forecasts. By combining their forecasts, point forecast accuracy is improved. As measured by averaged coverage probability deviance, the Hyndman-Ullah methods generally provide more accurate interval forecasts than the Lee-Carter methods. However, the Hyndman-Ullah methods produce wider half-widths of prediction interval than the Lee-Carter methods. Conclusions: Model averaging approach should be considered to produce more accurate point forecasts. Comments: This study is a sequel to another Demographic Research paper by Shang, Booth and Hyndman (2011), in which the authors compared the principal component methods for forecasting age-specific mortality rates and life expectancy at birth.

abstract = {The analysis of climate data has relied heavily on hypothesis-driven statistical methods, while projections of future climate are based primarily on physics-based computational models. However, in recent years a wealth of new datasets has become available. Therefore, we take a more data-centric approach and propose a unified framework for studying climate, with an aim toward characterizing observed phenomena as well as discovering new knowledge in climate science. Specifically, we posit that complex networks are well suited for both descriptive analysis and predictive modeling tasks. We show that the structural properties of 'climate networks' have useful interpretation within the domain. Further, we extract clusters from these networks and demonstrate their predictive power as climate indices. Our experimental results establish that the network clusters are statistically significantly better predictors than clusters derived using a more traditional clustering approach. Using complex networks as data representation thus enables the unique opportunity for descriptive and predictive modeling to inform each other. 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Longevity swaps have been one of the major success stories of pension scheme de-risking in recent years. However, with some few exceptions, all of the transactions to date have been bespoke longevity swaps based upon the mortality experience of a portfolio of named lives. In order for this market to start to meet its true potential, solutions will ultimately be needed that provide protection for all types of members, are cost effective for large and smaller schemes, are tradable, and enable access to the wider capital markets. Index-based solutions have the potential to meet this need; however, concerns remain with these solutions. In particular, the basis risk emerging from the potential mismatch between the underlying forces of mortality for the index reference portfolio and the pension fund/annuity book being hedged is the principal issue that has, to date, prevented many schemes progressing their consideration of index-based solutions. Two-population stochastic mortality models offer an alternative to overcome this obstacle as they allow market participants to compare and project the mortality experience for the reference and target populations and thus assess the amount of demographic basis risk involved in an index-based longevity hedge. In this paper, we systematically assess the suitability of several multi-population stochastic mortality models for assessing basis risks and provide guidelines on how to use these models in practical situations paying particular attention to the data requirements for the appropriate calibration and forecasting of such models.},

Recent developments in econometrics allow, through Vector Error Correction Models (VECM), to model multivariate dynamic systems including time dependency between economic variables. Common trends that exist between the variables may then be highlighted, the relation between these variables being represented by a long-run equilibrium relationship. In this work, VECM are developed for causes-of-death mortality. We analyze the five main causes of death across ten major countries representing a diversity of developed economies. The World Health Organization website provides cause-of-death information over about the last 60 years. Our analysis reveals that long-run equilibrium relationships exist between the five main causes of death, improving our understanding of the nature of dependence between these com peting risks over recent years. It also highlights that countries had usually different past experience in regards to cause-of-death mortality trends and thus, applying results from one country to another may be misleading.},

This paper aims to examine the application of a new combination of existing approaches to the analysis of regional population pyramids to offer such an overview. Symbolic data analysis and cluster analysis are used to identify typical shapes of population pyramids, before applying join-count tests to examine the spatial distribution of these pyramid shapes. The data used are for 1397 NUTS regional units in 37 European countries in 2015. We find that Irish regions, Cyprus and some of the capital cities of Western Europe present the youngest population across Europe, while the population of Eastern Germany is the oldest and shrinking in size. Countries of East-central Europe are the most homogeneous in their demographic processes for the chosen period, while the large demographic discrepancies occur within Spain, France, the UK, Finland, and Sweden between NUTS regions. A spatial study indicated positive spatial autocorrelation, and the transnational character of demographic processes across Europe. For a detailed examination of East-central Europe, we applied local statistics, and revealed three transnational spatial clusters resulting from historical and socio-economic processes.},

Using a unique data set matching administrative and survey data, this study explores trends in these differentials by lifetime earnings for the 1983-2003 period. Results indicate a consistent increase in mortality differentials across sex and age groups. The study also finds a substantial increase in life expectancy differentials by lifetime earnings: the top-to-bottom quintile premium increased 30 percent for men and almost doubled for women. These results complement recent research to point to almost five decades of increasing differential mortality in the United States.},

abstract = {The distinction between senescent and non-senescent mortality proves to be very valuable for describing and analysing age patterns of death rates. Unfortunately, standard methods for estimating these mortality components are lacking. The first part of this paper discusses alternative methods for estimating background and senescent mortality among adults and proposes a simple approach based on death rates by causes of death. The second part examines trends in senescent life expectancy (i.e., the life expectancy implied by senescent mortality) and compares them with trends in conventional longevity indicators between 1960 and 2000 in a group of 17 developed countries with low mortality. Senescent life expectancy for females rises at an average rate of 1.54 years per decade between 1960 and 2000 in these countries. The shape of the distribution of senescent deaths by age remains relatively invariant while the entire distribution shifts over time to higher ages as longevity rises.},

abstract = {Ungrouping binned data can be desirable for many reasons: Bins can be too coarse to allow for accurate analysis; comparisons can be hindered when different grouping approaches are used in different histograms; and the last interval is often wide and open-ended and, thus, covers a lot of information in the tail area. Age group-specific disease incidence rates and abridged life tables are examples of binned data. We propose a versatile method for ungrouping histograms that assumes that only the underlying distribution is smooth. Because of this modest assumption, the approach is suitable for most applications. The method is based on the composite link model, with a penalty added to ensure the smoothness of the target distribution. Estimates are obtained by maximizing a penalized likelihood. This maximization is performed efficiently by a version of the iteratively reweighted least-squares algorithm. Optimal values of the smoothing parameter are chosen by minimizing Akaike's Information Criterion. We demonstrate the performance of this method in a simulation study and provide several examples that illustrate the approach. Wide, open-ended intervals can be handled properly. The method can be extended to the estimation of rates when both the event counts and the exposures to risk are grouped.},

In this conceptual report, the third in a Series on equity and equality in health in the USA, we use a contemporary and historical perspective to discuss research and interventions that grapple with the implications of what is known as structural racism on population health and health inequities. Structural racism refers to the totality of ways in which societies foster racial discrimination through mutually reinforcing systems of housing, education, employment, earnings, benefits, credit, media, health care, and criminal justice. These patterns and practices in turn reinforce discriminatory beliefs, values, and distribution of resources. We argue that a focus on structural racism offers a concrete, feasible, and promising approach towards advancing health equity and improving population health.},

abstract = {A demographic measure is often expressed as a deterministic or stochastic function of multiple variables (covariates), and a general problem (the decomposition problem) is to assess contributions of individual covariates to a difference in the demographic measure (dependent variable) between two populations. We propose a method of decomposition analysis based on an assumption that co- variates change continuously along an actual or hypothetical dimension. This assumption leads to a general model that logically justifies the additivity of covariate effects and the elimination of interaction terms, even if the dependent variable itself is a nonadditive function. A comparison with earlier methods illustrates other practical advantages of the method: in addition to an absence of residuals or interaction terms, the method can easily handle a large number of covariates and does not require a logically meaningful ordering of covariates. Two empirical examples show that the method can be applied flexibly to a wide variety of decomposition problems. This study also suggests that when data are available at multiple time points over a long interval, it is more accurate to compute an aggregated decomposition based on multiple subintervals than to compute a single decomposition for the entire study period.},

We discuss these methods and present a number of examples. In these examples, BMA provides improved out-of-sample predictive performance.

In particular, we show that all key rate duration hedges of liabilities beyond the Last Liquid Point will be peculiar. Moreover, we show that there is a connection between the occurrence of negative discount factors and singularities in the convergence criterion used to calibrate the model. The main tool used for analysing hedges is a novel stochastic representation of the Smith-Wilson method. Further, we provide necessary conditions needed in order to construct similar, but hedgeable, discount curves.},

abstract = {With the continuous expansion of data availability in many large-scale, complex, and networked systems, such as surveillance, security, Internet, and finance, it becomes critical to advance the fundamental understanding of knowledge discovery and analysis from raw data to support decision-making processes. Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.},

In this paper, the first in a Series about health in Europe, we review developments in population health in Europe, with a focus on trends in mortality, and draw attention to the main successes and failures of health policy in the past four decades. In western Europe, life expectancy has improved almost continuously, but progress has been erratic in eastern Europe, and, as a result, disparities in male life expectancy between the two areas are greater now than they were four decades ago. The falls in mortality noted in western Europe are associated with many different causes of death and show the combined effects of economic growth, improved health care, and successful health policies (eg, tobacco control, road traffic safety). Less favourable mortality trends in eastern Europe show economic and health-care problems and a failure to implement effective health policies. The political history of Europe has left deep divisions in the health of the population. Important health challenges remain in both western and eastern Europe and signify unresolved issues in health policy (eg, alcohol, food) and rising health inequalities within countries. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

It is argued that unmodified or naively modified traditional information criteria cannot be used for order determination in the context of conditionally heteroscedastic models. The models selected using the modified criteria are then used to forecast both the conditional mean and the conditional variance of two high frequency exchange rate series. The analysis indicates that although the use of such model selection methods does lead to significantly improved forecasting accuracies for the conditional variance in some instances, these improvements are by no means universal. The use of these criteria to jointly select conditional mean and conditional variance model orders leads to performance degradation for the conditional mean forecasts compared to models which do not allow for the heteroscedasticity.},

abstract = {This paper considers the pricing of European call options written on pure endowment and deferred life annuity contracts, also known as guaranteed annuity options. These contracts provide a guaranteed value at the maturity of the option. The contract valuation is dependent on the stochastic interest rate and mortality processes. We assume single-factor stochastic square-root processes for both the interest rate and mortality intensity, with mortality being a time-inhomogeneous process. We then derive the pricing partial differential equation (PDE) and the corresponding transition density PDE for options written on the pure endowment and deferred annuity contracts. The general solution of the pricing PDE is derived as a function of the transition density function. We solve the transition density PDE by first transforming it to a system of characteristic PDEs using Laplace transform techniques and then applying the method of characteristics. Once an explicit expression for the density function is found, we then use sparse grid quadrature techniques to generate European call option prices on the pure endowment and deferred annuity contracts. This approach can easily be generalised to other contracts which are driven by similar stochastic processes presented in this paper. We test the sensitivity of the option prices by varying independent parameters in our model. As option maturity increases, the corresponding option prices significantly increase. The effect of mispricing the guaranteed annuity value is analysed, as is the benefit of replacing the whole-life annuity with a term annuity to remove volatility of the old age population. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Nigri2019,
abstract = {In the field of mortality, the Lee–Carter based approach can be considered the milestone to forecast mortality rates among stochastic models. We could define a “Lee–Carter model family” that embraces all developments of this model, including its first formulation (1992) that remains the benchmark for comparing the performance of future models. In the Lee–Carter model, the $\kappa$ t parameter, describing the mortality trend over time, plays an important role about the future mortality behavior. The traditional ARIMA process usually used to model $\kappa$ t shows evident limitations to describe the future mortality shape. Concerning forecasting phase, academics should approach a more plausible way in order to think a nonlinear shape of the projected mortality rates. Therefore, we propose an alternative approach the ARIMA processes based on a deep learning technique. More precisely, in order to catch the pattern of $\kappa$ t series over time more accurately, we apply a Recurrent Neural Network with a Long Short-Term Memory architecture and integrate the Lee–Carter model to improve its predictive capacity. The proposed approach provides significant performance in terms of predictive accuracy and also allow for avoiding the time-chunks' a priori selection. Indeed, it is a common practice among academics to delete the time in which the noise is overflowing or the data quality is insufficient. The strength of the Long Short-Term Memory network lies in its ability to treat this noise and adequately reproduce it into the forecasted trend, due to its own architecture enabling to take into account significant long-term patterns.},

abstract = {Two areas still need further examination in the ecological study of inequality and mortality. First, the evidence for the relationship between income inequality and mortality remains inconclusive, particularly when the analytic unit is small (e.g., county in the U.S.). Second, most previous studies are cross-sectional and are unable to address the recent diverging patterns whereby mortality has decreased and income inequality increased. This study aims to contribute to both topic areas by studying the relationship between inequality and mortality via a spatiotemporal approach that simultaneously considers the spatial structure and the temporal trends of inequality and mortality using county panel data between 1990 and 2010 for the conterminous U.S. Using both spatial panel random effect and spatial panel fixed effect models, we found that (a) income inequality was not a significant factor for mortality after taking into account the spatiotemporal structure and the most salient factors for mortality (e.g., socioeconomic status); (b) the spatial panel fixed effect model indicated that income inequality was negatively associated with mortality over the time, a relationship mirroring the diverging patterns; and (c) the significant spatial and temporal fixed effects suggested that both dimensions are critical factors in understanding the inequality-mortality relationship in the U.S. Our findings lend support to the argument that income inequality does not affect mortality and suggest that the cross-sectional findings may be a consequence of ignoring the temporal trends.},

abstract = {For insurance companies in Europe, the introduction of Solvency II leads to a tightening of rules for solvency capital provision. In life insurance, this especially affects retirement products that contain a significant portion of longevity risk (for example conventional annuities). Insurance companies might react by price increases for those products, and, at the same time, might think of alternatives that shift longevity risk (at least partially) to policyholders. In the extreme case, this leads to so-called tontine products where the insurance company's role is merely administrative and longevity risk is shared within a pool of policyholders. From the policyholder's viewpoint, such products are, however, not desirable as they lead to a high uncertainty of retirement income at old ages. In this article, we alternatively suggest a so-called tonuity that combines the appealing features of tontine and conventional annuity. Until some fixed age (the switching time), a tonuity's payoff is tontine-like, afterwards the policyholder receives a secure payment of a (deferred) annuity. A tonuity is attractive for both the retiree (who benefits from a secure income at old ages) and the insurance company (whose capital requirements are reduced compared to conventional annuities). The tonuity is a possibility to offer tailor-made retirement products: using risk capital charges linked to Solvency II, we show that retirees with very low or very high risk aversion prefer a tontine or conventional annuity, respectively. Retirees with medium risk aversion, however, prefer a tonuity. In a utility-based framework, we therefore determine the optimal tonuity characterized by the critical switching time that maximizes the policyholder's lifetime utility.},

abstract = {Many common models of mortality can be expressed compactly in the language of either generalized linear models or generalized non-linear models. The R language provides a description of these models which parallels the usual algebraic definitions but has the advantage of a transparent and flexible model specification. We compare eight model structures for mortality. For each structure, we consider (a) the Poisson models for the force of mortality with both log and logit link functions and (b) the binomial models for the rate of mortality with logit and complementary log–log link functions. Part of this work shows how to extend the usual smooth two-dimensional P-spline model for the force of mortality with Poisson error and log link to the other smooth two-dimensional P-spline models with Poisson and binomial errors defined in (a) and (b). Our comments are based on the results of fitting these models to data from six countries:Australia, France, Japan, Sweden, UK and USA. We also discuss the possibility of forecasting with these models; in particular, the introduction of cohort terms generally leads to an improvement in overall fit, but can also make forecasting with these models problematic.},

We propose a new loss function that can be incorporated into any maximum likelihood objective with hierarchical data, resulting in reconciled estimates with confidence intervals that correctly account for additional uncertainty due to imperfect reconciliation. We evaluate our method using a non-linear model and synthetic data on a counterfactual forecasting problem, where we have access to the ground truth and contemporaneous covariates, and show that we largely improve over the existing state-of-the-art method.},

abstract = {In this Series paper, we examine how mass incarceration shapes inequality in health. The USA is the world leader in incarceration, which disproportionately affects black populations. Nearly one in three black men will ever be imprisoned, and nearly half of black women currently have a family member or extended family member who is in prison. However, until recently the public health implications of mass incarceration were unclear. Most research in this area has focused on the health of current and former inmates, with findings suggesting that incarceration could produce some short-term improvements in physical health during imprisonment but has profoundly harmful effects on physical and mental health after release. The emerging literature on the family and community effects of mass incarceration points to negative health impacts on the female partners and children of incarcerated men, and raises concerns that excessive incarceration could harm entire communities and thus might partly underlie health disparities both in the USA and between the USA and other developed countries. Research into interventions, policies, and practices that could mitigate the harms of incarceration and the post-incarceration period is urgently needed, particularly studies using rigorous experimental or quasi-experimental designs.},

True e0 was within the ex ante 95{\%} probability interval 97{\%} of the time overall, but intervals were too broad up to 40 years and too narrow after 50 years.

There exists a great variety of products with both, guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) and guaranteed minimum living benefits (GMLB). Although several approaches for pricing some of the corresponding guarantees have been proposed in the academic literature, there is no general framework in which the existing variety of such guarantees can be priced consistently. The present paper fills this gap by introducing a model, which permits a consistent and extensive analysis of all types of guarantees currently offered within Variable Annuity contracts. Besides a valuation assuming that the policyholder follows a given strategy with respect to surrender and withdrawals, we are able to price the contract under optimal policyholder behavior. Using both, Monte-Carlo methods and a generalization of a finite mesh discretization approach, we find that some guarantees are overpriced, whereas others, e.g. guaranteed annuities within guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB), are offered significantly below their risk-neutral value.},

This paper presents clusters of the world's countries obtained by a novel weighted clustering method. The approach is based on data representations with symbolic descriptions of age–sex structures. To obtain clusters with similar descriptions, a weighted clustering method is used which is suitable for data described with discrete distributions. In contrast to the classical approach, this method allows the population of each sex to be included in the clustering process, thereby obtaining a representative age–sex structure corresponding to all the countries contained in the cluster. Observing the data over time reveals clusters of countries with similar changes in their population age–sex distributions. The resulting population pyramids are presented for 1996, 2001, and 2006.},

abstract = {Month of birth influences adult life expectancy at ages 50+. Why? In two countries of the Northern Hemisphere-Austria and Denmark-people born in autumn (October-December) live longer than those born in spring (April-June). Data for Australia show that, in the Southern Hemisphere, the pattern is shifted by half a year. The lifespan pattern of British immigrants to Australia is similar to that of Austrians and Danes and significantly different from that of Australians. These findings are based on population data with more than a million observations and little or no selectivity. The differences in lifespan are independent of the seasonal distribution of deaths and the social differences in the seasonal distribution of births. In the Northern Hemisphere, the excess mortality in the first year of life of infants born in spring does not support the explanation of selective infant survival. Instead, remaining life expectancy at age 50 appears to depend on factors that arise in utero or early in infancy and that increase susceptibility to diseases later in life. This result is consistent with the finding that, at the turn of the last century, infants born in autumn had higher birth weights than those born in other seasons. Furthermore, differences in adult lifespan by month of birth decrease over time and are significantly smaller in more recent cohorts, which benefited from substantial improvements in maternal and infant health.},

@article{Merton1976a,
abstract = {The validity of the classic Black-Scholes option pricing formula depends on the capability of investors to follow a dynamic portfolio strategy in the stock that replicates the payoff structure to the option. The critical assumption required for such a strategy to be feasible, is that the underlying stock return dynamics can be described by a stochastic process with a continuous sample path. In this paper, an option pricing formula is derived for the more-general case when the underlying stock returns are generated by a mixture of both continuous and jump processes. The derived formula has most of the attractive features of the original Black-Scholes formula in that it does not depend on investor preferences or knowledge of the expected return on the underlying stock. Moreover, the same analysis applied to the options can be extended to the pricing of corporate liabilities. ?? 1976.},

We present a newly-collected dataset on aggregate population mortality from eleven countries in APAC, which we rank based on their economic development. Using lead-lag analysis, we identify short-term predictability in mortality risk across countries. Mortality improvements seem to appear faster in more developed than less developed countries. Such predictability is useful for longevity risk financing and in producing cross-country mortality indices. We propose ways in which our results can benefit institutions manage their exposure in APAC mortality and longevity risk},

We then build several mortality-interest duration and convexity matching strategies to determine the weights of whole life insurance and deferred whole life annuity products in a portfolio and evaluate the value at risk and the hedge effectiveness of the weighted portfolio surplus at time zero. Numerical illustrations show that using the mortality-interest duration and convexity matching strategies with respect to an instantaneously proportional change in $\mu$∗ can more effectively hedge the longevity risk and interest rate risk embedded in the deferred whole life annuity products than using the mortality-only duration and convexity matching strategies with respect to an instantaneously proportional shift or an instantaneously constant movement in $\mu$ only.},

This method steers a middle course between forecasting aggregates and forecasting individual age specific rates: we reduce the problem to forecasting a single parameter for fertility and another one for mortality. We have described a number of refinements and extensions of those basic methods, which preserve their underlying structure and simplicity. In particular, we show how one can fit the model more simply, incorporate lower bounds to the forecasts of rates, disaggregate by sex or race, and prepare integrated forecasts of rates for a collection of regions. We also discuss alternate approaches to forecasting the estimated indices of fertility and mortality, including state-space methods. These many versions of the basic method have yielded remarkably similar results." (SUMMARY IN FRE)},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe the population mortality profile of England and Wales by deprivation and in each government office region (GOR) during 1998, and to quantify the influence of geography and deprivation in determining life expectancy. DESIGN: Construction of life tables describing age specific mortality rates and life expectancy at birth from death registrations and estimated population counts. Life tables were created for (a) quintiles of income deprivation based on the income domain score of the index of multiple deprivation 2000, (b) each GOR and Wales, and (c) every combination of deprivation and geography. SETTING: England and Wales.PATIENTS/ PARTICIPANTS: Residents of England and Wales, 1998. MAIN RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth varies with deprivation quintile and is highest in the most affluent groups. The differences are mainly attributable to differences in mortality rates under 75 years of age. Regional life expectancies display a clear north-south gradient. Linear regression analysis shows that deprivation explains most of the geographical variation in life expectancy. CONCLUSIONS: Geographical patterns of life expectancy identified within these data for England and Wales in 1998 are mainly attributable to variations in deprivation status as defined by the IMD 2000 income domain score.},

Our approach respects the basic economic requirement that LIBOR rates are non-negative, and the basic requirement from mathematical finance that LIBOR rates are analytically tractable martingales with respect to their own forward measure. Additionally, and most importantly, our approach also leads to analytically tractable expressions of multi-LIBOR payoffs. This approach unifies therefore the advantages of well-known forward price models with those of classical LIBOR rate models. Several examples are added and prototypical volatility smiles are shown. We believe that the CIR-process based LIBOR model might be of particular interest for applications, since closed form valuation formulas for caps and swaptions are derived.},

abstract = {Recent research has shown that after long-term declining trends are excluded, mortality rates in industrial countries tend to rise in economic expansions and fall in economic recessions. In the present work, co-movements between economic fluctuations and mortality changes in postwar Japan are investigated by analyzing time series of mortality rates and eight economic indicators. To eliminate spurious associations attributable to trends, series are detrended either via Hodrick-Prescott filtering or through differencing. As previously found in other industrial economies, general mortality and age-specific death rates in Japan tend to increase in expansions and drop in recessions, for both males and females. The effect, which is slightly stronger for males, is particularly noticeable in those aged 45-64. Deaths attributed to heart disease, pneumonia, accidents, liver disease, and senility--making up about 41{\%} of total mortality--tend to fluctuate procyclically, increasing in expansions. Suicides, as well as deaths attributable to diabetes and hypertensive disease, make up about 4{\%} of total mortality and fluctuate countercyclically, increasing in recessions. Deaths attributed to other causes, making up about half of total deaths, don't show a clearly defined relationship with the fluctuations of the economy.},

When hedging such trades, investors cannot freely trade protection on their own name, thus facing an incomplete market. This fact is reflected in the non-uniqueness of the pricing measure, which is only constrained by the values of the hedging instruments tradable by the investor. Uncollateralized trades should then be considered not as derivatives but as new primary assets in the investor's economy. Different choices of the risk-neutral measure correspond to different completions of the market, based on the risk appetite of the investor, leading to different levels of value adjustments.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Stacked generalization is a general method of using a high-level model to combine lower-level models to achieve greater predictive accuracy. In this paper we address two crucial issues which have been considered to be a `black art' in classification tasks ever since the introduction of stacked generalization in 1992 by Wolpert: the type of generalizer that is suitable to derive the higher-level model, and the kind of attributes that should be used as its input. We find that best results are obtained when the higher-level model combines the confidence (and not just the predictions) of the lower-level ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of stacked generalization for combining three different types of learning algorithms for classification tasks. We also compare the performance of stacked generalization with majority vote and published results of arcing and bagging.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {There are several methods for building prediction models. The wealth of currently available modeling techniques usually forces the researcher to judge, a priori, what will likely be the best method. Super learning (SL) is a methodology that facilitates this decision by combining all identified prediction algorithms pertinent for a particular prediction problem. SL generates a final model that is at least as good as any of the other models considered for predicting the outcome. The overarching aim of this work is to introduce SL to analysts and practitioners. This work compares the performance of logistic regression, penalized regression, random forests, deep learning neural networks, and SL to predict successful substance use disorders (SUD) treatment. A nationwide database including 99,013 SUD treatment patients was used. All algorithms were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in a test sample that was not included in the training sample used to fit the prediction models. AUC for the models ranged between 0.793 and 0.820. SL was superior to all but one of the algorithms compared. An explanation of SL steps is provided. SL is the first step in targeted learning, an analytic framework that yields double robust effect estimation and inference with fewer assumptions than the usual parametric methods. Different aspects of SL depending on the context, its function within the targeted learning framework, and the benefits of this methodology in the addiction field are discussed.},

abstract = {AAAAAA The analysis of compositional data is a topic inherent to demography. In recent times, due to a growing catalogue of detailed population data, it became feasible to consider populations not only structured by time, age or sex, but by any number of interesting criteria. This " innation " of data dimensions produces challenges in visualizing the data. To aid the understanding of age-structured timelines of compositions we seek to extend the Lexis surface plot from 1-dimensional continuous data to multidimensional compositional data. We apply diierent strategies for visualizing compositional data on the Lexis surface to French death counts given by cause and compare the results for compliance with multiple desired criteria. From the display of population numbers by shading map regions, the graphical representa-tion of population dynamics on a grid of year-age-cohort parallels, and the widely recognized population pyramid to today's heatmaps of mortality surfaces: Demography has always had a close relationship with information visualization. 1 The visual display helps making sense of the data at hand which in demography, for the most part, are counts, rates and proportions. Vi-sualisation methods that are currently used in demography present counts or rates. This paper is about compositional data, represented by proportions, i. e. shares of a whole. Examples for this data type are proportions within a population (e. g. age composition, distribution by occu-pation, region of residence or level of education), proportions of events (e. g. deaths by cause),},

The study conducts a data generating process (DGP) to argue the typical “rule of thumb” used in DEA, e.g. the required number of observations should be at least larger than twice of the number of inputs and outputs, is ambiguous and will produce large deviations in estimating the technical efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) variable selection technique, which is usually used in data science for extracting significant factors, and combine it in a sign-constrained convex nonparametric least squares (SCNLS), which can be regarded as DEA estimator. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LASSO-SCNLS method and its variants provide useful guidelines for the DEA with small datasets.},

abstract = {Assumptions about future mortality are more important than those for factors such as fertility, migration, disability trends or real interest rates for cost projections of the U.S. Old Age, Survivors, Disability and Health Insurance scheme. Recently, one factor has been assumed to be the key driver of future mortality in both official British population projections and actuarial ones: a `cohort effect' associated with a group who were born in a period centred on the early 1930s who have been identified as having experienced particularly rapid improvements in mortality rates and are often referred to as the `golden generations' or `golden cohorts'. The concept of `cohort effects' is discussed; limitations of national-level cohort data considered; and methods for identifying such effects are reviewed. Particular attention is given to the analysis of populations which have been identified as having clear cut cohort effects; those of Britain and Sweden in the later part of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, as well as the contemporary British population. The likely magnitude of such effects is discussed using a stylised model to assess the extent to which members of the `golden generations' are especially privileged.},

@article{Holford2006,
abstract = {Age-period-cohort models have provided useful insights into the analysis of time trends for disease rates, in spite of the well known identifiability problem. Unique parameter estimates that avoid arbitrary constraints are provided by estimable functions of the parameter estimates. For data that are generated using equal interval widths for age and period, the identifiability issue may be expressed in terms of the age, period and cohort slopes. However, when the interval widths are not the same for age and period, additional identifiability problems arise. These may be represented in terms of macro-trends, which have the identical identifiability problem seen in the equal interval case, and micro-trends, which are the source of the additional problems. A framework for testing estimability is presented, and a variety of potentially interesting functions of the parameters considered. Unlike the equal interval case, drift is not estimable for unequal intervals, but local drift may be. In addition, the available functions for forecasting are much more restrictive in the latter case. This estimability problem induces cyclical patterns in the estimates of trend as is demonstrated using data on leukaemia in Connecticut males, but this can be avoided through the use of smoothing splines. These methods of are illustrated for three-year period and five-year age intervals using data on lung cancer mortality in Californian women.},

In this paper, we contribute a delta hedging strategy for use with the M7–M5 model, taking into account of not only period effect uncertainty but also cohort effect uncertainty and population basis risk. To enhance practicality, the hedging strategy is formulated in both static and dynamic settings, and its effectiveness can be evaluated in terms of either variance or 1-year ahead Value-at-Risk (the latter is highly relevant to solvency capital requirements). Three real data illustrations are constructed to demonstrate (1) the impact of population basis risk and cohort effect uncertainty on hedge effectiveness, (2) the benefit of dynamically adjusting a delta longevity hedge, and (3) the relationship between risk premium and hedge effectiveness.},

Despite the long-time observation of converging mortality risks in differential socioeconomic mortality research, the interest in the connection between frailty, selection, and health and mortality inequalities over a life course approach has increased only recently. This overview of the literature summarizes the main concepts of unobserved frailty and socioeconomic differences in mortality and how frailty and selection relate to these differences at old ages. It then reviews the evidence coming from the existing studies. Although the number of studies is still limited, the body of research on unobserved frailty and socioeconomic inequalities in health and mortality in a life course approach is growing. The results, however, are contradictory, and whether selection plays a major role in shaping the observed socioeconomic mortality patterns at old ages is still controversial.},

abstract = {Objectives Two processes generate total variance in age at death: heterogeneity (between-group variance) and individual stochasticity (within-group variance). Limited research has evaluated how these two components have changed over time. We quantify the degree to which area-level deprivation contributed to total variance in age at death in Scotland between 1981 and 2011. Design Full population and mortality data for Scotland were obtained and matched with the Carstairs score, a standardised z-score calculated for each part-postcode sector that measures relative area-level deprivation. A z-score above zero indicates that the part-postcode sector experienced higher deprivation than the national average. A z-score below zero indicates lower deprivation. From the aggregated data we constructed 40 lifetables, one for each deprivation quintile in 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011 stratified by sex. Primary outcome measures Total variance in age at death and the proportion explained by area-level deprivation heterogeneity (between-group variance). results The most deprived areas experienced stagnating or slightly increasing variance in age at death. The least deprived areas experienced decreasing variance. For males, the most deprived quintile life expectancy was between 7{\%} and 11{\%} lower and the SD is between 6{\%} and 25{\%} higher than the least deprived. This suggests that the effect of deprivation on the SD of longevity is comparable to its effect on life expectancy. Decomposition analysis revealed that contributions from between-group variance doubled between 1981 and 2011 but at most only explained 4{\%} of total variance. Conclusions This study adds to the emerging body of literature demonstrating that socioeconomic groups have experienced diverging trends in variance in age at death. The contribution from area-level deprivation to total variance in age at death, which we were able to capture, has doubled since 1981. Area-level deprivation may play an increasingly important role in mortality inequalities. bACkgrOunD The relationship between socioeconomic inequality and mortality is traditionally based on life expectancy comparisons. The most deprived populations experience the lowest average age at death, and the least deprived},

abstract = {Age-period-cohort (APC) models are frequently used to analyze mortality or morbidity rates stratified by age group and period. For the case in which rates are given in different strata, multivariate APC models have been considered only recently. Such models share a set of parameters, for example, the age effects, while the other parameters may vary across strata. We show that differences of strata-specific effects are identifiable. We then propose a Bayesian approach based on smoothing priors to estimate multivariate APC models. This provides an alternative to maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of relative risk in the case of equal intervals and gives useful results even in the case of unequal intervals, where ML estimates have severe artifacts. This is illustrated with data on female mortality in Denmark and Norway and data on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality of males in England and Wales, stratified by 3 different areas: Greater London, conurbations excluding Greater London, and nonconurbation areas.},

With the exception of black males, all recent gains in life expectancy at age twenty-five have occurred among better-educated groups, raising educational differentials in life expectancy by 30 percent.

abstract = {The prediction of future mortality rates by any existing mortality models is hardly exact, which causes an exposure to mortality (longevity) risk for life insurers (annuity providers). Since a change in mortality rates has opposite impacts on the surpluses of life insurance and annuity, hedging strategies of mortality and longevity risks can be implemented by creating an insurance portfolio of both life insurance and annuity products. In this article, we apply relational models to capture the mortality movements by assuming that the realized mortality sequence is a proportional change and/or a constant shift of the expected one, and the size of the changes varies in the length of the sequences. Then we create a variety of non-size-free matching strategies to determine the weights of life insurance and annuity products in an insurance portfolio for mortality immunization, where the weights depend on the sizes of the proportional and/or constant changes. Comparing the hedging performances of four non-size-free matching strategies with corresponding size-free ones proposed by Lin and Tsai, we demonstrate with simulation illustrations that the non-size-free matching strategies can hedge against mortality and longevity risks more effectively than the size-free ones.},

The methodology uses generalized dynamic factor models fitted to the differences in the log-mortality rates. We compare their prediction performance with that of models previously described in the literature, including the traditional static factor model fitted to log-mortality rates. We also construct risk measures using vine-copula simulations, which take into account the dependence between the idiosyncratic components of the mortality rates. The methodology is applied to forecast mortality rates for a population portfolio for the UK and to estimate longevity and mortality risks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We show how to price and adequately hedge the annuity payouts in a general financial environment. In particular, our model accounts for various stylized facts of stock returns such as asymmetry and heavy-tailedness. Furthermore, the generality of our framework makes it possible to explore the impact of a parameter misspecification on the annuity price and the hedging performance.},

abstract = {Background: Access to skilled obstetric delivery and emergency care is deemed crucial for reducing maternal mortality. We assessed pregnancy-related mortality by distance to health facilities and by cause of death in a disadvantaged rural area of southern Tanzania. Methods: We did a secondary analysis of cross-sectional georeferenced census data collected from June to October, 2007, in five rural districts of southern Tanzania. Heads of georeferenced households were asked about household deaths in the period June 1, 2004, to May 31, 2007, and women aged 13-49 years were interviewed about birth history in the same time period. Causes of death in women of reproductive age were ascertained by verbal autopsy. We also asked for sociodemographic information. Multilevel logistic regression was used to analyse the effects of distance to health facilities providing delivery care on pregnancy-related mortality (direct and indirect maternal and coincidental deaths). Findings: The study included 818 583 people living in 225 980 households. Pregnancy-related mortality was high at 712 deaths per 100 000 livebirths, with haemorrhage being the leading cause of death. Deaths due to direct causes of maternal mortality were strongly related to distance, with mortality increasing from 111 per 100 000 livebirths among women who lived within 5 km to 422 deaths per 100 000 livebirths among those who lived more than 35 km from a hospital (adjusted odds ratio 3{\textperiodcentered}68; 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}37-9{\textperiodcentered}88). Neither pregnancy-related nor indirect maternal mortality was associated with distance to hospital. Among women who lived within 5 km of a hospital, pregnancy-related mortality was 664 deaths per 100 000 livebirths even though 72{\%} gave birth in hospital and 8{\%} had delivery by caesarean section. Interpretation: Large distances to hospital contribute to high levels of direct obstetric mortality. High pregnancy-related mortality in those living near to a hospital suggests deficiencies in quality of care. Funding: Bill {\&} Melinda Gates Foundation.},

Such forecasts would be an input to the production of probabilistic population projections for all countries, which is currently being considered by the United Nations. To evaluate the method, we conducted an out-of-sample cross-validation experiment, fitting the model to the data from 1950-1995 and using the estimated model to forecast for the subsequent 10 years. The 10-year predictions had a mean absolute error of about 1 year, about 40 {\%} less than the current UN methodology. The probabilistic forecasts were calibrated in the sense that, for example, the 80 {\%} prediction intervals contained the truth about 80 {\%} of the time. We illustrate our method with results from Madagascar (a typical country with steadily improving life expectancy), Latvia (a country that has had a mortality crisis), and Japan (a leading country). We also show aggregated results for South Asia, a region with eight countries. Free, publicly available R software packages called bayesLife and bayesDem are available to implement the method.},

abstract = {Background: After a long decline, life expectancy in Russia substantially increased in 2004-2010; this is the longest period of health improvement that has been observed in the country since 1965. This study is the first analysis of this positive trend. Objective: We seek to determine the causes and age groups that account for the additional years of life gained in 2004-10 and the remaining gap between Russia and Western countries, to assess to what extent these recent trends represent a new development relative to previous mortality fluctuations, and to identify possible explanations for the improvement. Methods: We present an analysis of trends in life expectancy, and in age- and cause-specific mortality in Russia and selected countries in Eastern and Western Europe. We use decomposition techniques to examine the life expectancy rise in 2004-2010 and the Russia-UK life expectancy gap in 2010. Results: Like the previous mortality fluctuations that have occurred in Russia since the mid-1980s, the increase in life expectancy was driven by deaths at ages 15 to 60 from alcohol-related causes. Uniquely in the recent period, there were also improvements at older ages, especially in cerebrovascular disease mortality among women. In addition, there were reductions in deaths from avoidable causes, such as from tuberculosis and diabetes. The life expectancy gap between Russia and Western countries remains large, and is mostly attributable to deaths from cardiovascular disease, alcohol-related conditions, and violence. Conclusions: The decrease in alcohol-related mortality may be attributable to measures taken in 2006 to control the production and sale of ethanol. The lower number of cerebrovascular-related deaths may reflect advancements in blood pressure control. The reduction in the number of deaths from tuberculosis and diabetes may be associated with a general improvement in health care. Although the decline in mortality since 2004 has been substantial, the question of whether it can be sustained remains open.},

abstract = {In this paper, we define the mortality durations and convexities of the prices of life insurance and annuity products with respect to an instantaneously proportional change and an instantaneously parallel shift, respectively, in $\mu$s (the forces of mortality), ps (the one-year survival probabilities) and qs (the one-year death probabilities), and further derive them as magnitude-free closed-form formulas. Then we propose several duration/convexity matching strategies to determine the weights of two or three products in an insurance portfolio. With the stochastic mortality models, we evaluate the Value-at-Risk (VaR) values and the hedge effectiveness of the surpluses at time zero for the underlying portfolio with these matching strategies. Illustrated numerical examples demonstrate that the duration/convexity matching strategies with respect to an instantaneously proportional change in $\mu$s and qs can significantly hedge the mortality/longevity risks. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background Long term dialysis is life-saving for patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). However, in ESRD patients with multiple comorbid conditions, dialysis may actually be futile, and conservative management is advisable. We studied the life expectancy of Chinese ESRD patients treated conservatively. Methods We reviewed 63 consecutive ESRD patients who were treated conservatively in our center. Duration of survival was computed from the date of initial assessment for dialysis, as well as the expected date of needing dialysis based on previous trend of renal function decline. Results At the end of the observation period, 55 patients died. Twelve patients died before the expected date of needing dialysis because of unrelated reasons, while 36 deaths were directly attributed to uremia. The median overall survival after initial assessment for dialysis was 41.3 months (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 33.2 to 49.4 months). The median overall survival was 6.58 months (inter-quartile range, 0.92 to 9.33 months) from the theoretical date of needing dialysis. The survival from the theoretical date of needing dialysis did not correlate with patient age, sex, diabetic status, or baseline renal function. Conclusions In Chinese ESRD patients treated conservatively, the median survival is around 6 months after the theoretical date of needing dialysis. Our result provides an important piece of information for the decision of dialysis and patient counseling.},

abstract = {In this paper, we quantitatively compare the forecasts from four different mortality models. We consider one discrete-time model proposed by Lee and Carter (1992) and three continuous-time models: the Wills and Sherris (2011) model, the Feller process and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. The first two models estimate the whole surface of mortality simultaneously, while in the latter two, each generation is modelled and calibrated separately. We calibrate the models to UK and Australian population data. We find that all the models show relatively similar absolute total error for a given dataset, except the Lee-Carter model, whose performance differs significantly. To evaluate the forecasting performance we therefore look at two alternative measures: the relative error between the forecasted and the actual mortality rates and the percentage of actual mortality rates which fall within a prediction interval. In terms of the prediction intervals, the results are more divergent since each model implies a different structure for the variance of mortality rates. According to our experiments, the Wills and Sherris model produces superior results in terms of the prediction intervals. However, in terms of the mean absolute error, the OU and the Feller processes perform better. The forecasting performance of the Lee Carter model is mostly dependent on the choice of the dataset.},

The growing availability of micro-level data creates challenges for researchers and decision makers in terms of choosing the right level of data aggregation for inference and decisions. Simpson's paradox describes the case where the direction of a causal effect is reversed in the aggregated data compared to the disaggregated data. Detecting whether Simpson's paradox occurs in a dataset used for decision making is therefore critical. This study introduces the use of Classification and Regression Trees for automated detection of potential Simpson's paradoxes in data with few or many potential confounding variables, and even with large samples (big data). Our approach relies on the tree structure and the location of the cause vs. the confounders in the tree. We discuss theoretical and computational aspects of the approach and illustrate it using several real applications in e-governance and healthcare.},

For each of these scenarios we calculate three quantities: released capital, expected profit and expected utility of resulting wealth. Using these inputs, we apply MADM to find optimal retention levels. We compare and contrast our findings with those when decisions are based on a single attribute.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this paper, we propose an alternative to the Lee-Carter model: an AR(1)-ARCH(1) model. More specifically, we compare the performance of these two models with respect to forecasting age-specific mortality in Italy. We fit the two models, with Gaussian and t-student innovations, for the matrix of Italian death rates from 1960 to 2003. We compare the forecast ability of the two approaches in out-of-sample analysis for the period 2004-2006 and find that the AR(1)-ARCH(1) model with t-student innovations provides the best fit among the models studied in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The life annuity business is heavily exposed to longevity risk. Risk transfer solutions are not yet fully developed, and when available they are expensive. A significant part of the risk must therefore be retained by the life insurer. So far, most of the research work on longevity risk has been mainly concerned with capital requirements and specific risk transfer solutions. However, the impact of longevity risk on shareholder value also deserves attention. While it is commonly accepted that a market-consistent valuation should be performed in this respect, the definition of a fair shareholder value for a life insurance business is not trivial. In this paper, we develop a multi-period market-consistent shareholder value model for a life annuity business. The model allows for systematic and idiosyncratic longevity risk and includes the most significant variables affecting shareholder value: the cost of capital (which in a market-consistent setting must be quantified in terms of frictional and agency costs, net of the value of the limited liability put option), policyholder demand elasticity and the cost of alternative longevity risk management solutions, namely indemnity-based and index-based solutions. We show how the model can be used for assessing the impact of different longevity risk management strategies on life insurer shareholder value and solvency.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The ageing population has not only had an important impact on health and social services, but was responsible for sparking the pensions crisis affecting both the public and commercial sector. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was used to quantify trends in cause-specific mortality in terms of absolute and relative change between 1991 and 2005 in the population aged 50 and over. Absolute change is quantified in terms of the numbers of deaths prevented or postponed (or conversely, increased or brought-forward) in a year compared to deaths in the baseline year. The percentage change in age-standardised rates was used to identify relative change in causes of death. RESULTS: Between 1991 and 2005 there was a continuous decline in overall all-cause death rates for people aged 50 and over. Age-standardised mortality declined by 30 per cent for men, from 3,216 per 100,000 men to 2,267 per 100,000. This resulted in 86,477 fewer male deaths in 2005 than would have occurred had 1991 rates persisted. For women the age-standardised mortality rate declined by 20 per cent from 2,032 per 100,000 to 1,626 per 100,000, resulting in 48,406 deaths postponed (or fewer deaths) in 2005.Of the total numbers of deaths postponed in 2005, ischaemic heart disease contributed the largest share for both men (45,244 deaths - 52.3 per cent) and women (33,601 - 69.4 per cent).The greatest decline in the mortality rate was observed for influenza, for which age-standardised rates fell by 89 per cent for men and 93 per cent for women. However the proportion of deaths in which influenza was the underlying cause was extremely small and so did not contribute a large proportion in terms of the total fall in numbers of deaths.Mortality rates from some conditions increased. Liver disease rates demonstrated some of the largest increases for both men and women aged 50 and over. For men the age-standardised mortality rate from liver disease increased by 104 per cent, resulting in 1,434 more deaths in 2005 than in 1991. CONCLUSIONS: The trends of decreasing mortality rates from ischaemic heart disease and stroke have continued into the 21(st) century, however both causes continue to be the biggest killers in England. They are projected to remain so, and consequently, to contribute significantly to the burden of disease in the population.The steady increase in liver disease mortality identified highlights the importance of tackling alcohol misuse as a public health priority.},

The hedging performances of some qualified matching strategies selected as representatives are evaluated by comparing their Value at Risk (VaR) values and variance reduction ratios for a base scenario. We also test some specific scenarios for the population basis risk, model risk, volatility and jump risks, and interest rate risk to see the impacts on the matching strategies. Numerical examples show that some convexity matching strategies overall outperform the others in the VaR value and in the effectiveness of hedging both longevity and mortality risks for two kinds of insurance portfolios. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society of Actuaries.},

In particular, we incorporate a variable representing the intensity of smoking within a cohort into the original Lee-Carter projection model. The introduction of this variable accounts for important anomalies in the recent age/sex pattern of mortality change and enables the use of a common temporal trend of mortality change for the 2 sexes. We project age-specific mortality rates for men and women at ages 50-84 between 2004 and 2034 in the United States. Because of reductions in smoking that have already occurred or can be reliably projected, mortality is projected to decline much faster when smoking is introduced into the model.},

@techreport{Mayhew2016,
abstract = {Foreword This very timely report highlights how, despite huge increases in life expectancy, the gap in lifespan between richest and poorest in society is increasing for the first time since the 1870s. Life expectancy increased in the early part of the 20 th Century due to, among other things, improvements in health, clean drinking water and the introduction of vaccination. This paper finds that in England and Wales, 5{\%} of men that have attained the age of 30 are living on average to 96.0 years, 33.3 years longer than the lowest 10{\%}. This gap grew by 1.7 years between 1993, when it was at its narrowest, and 2009. ILC-UK's own 2014 research (Linking State Pension Age to Longevity), supported by Age UK, found that measures such as healthy life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy vary significantly by region and social class. This trend is particularly worrying for society and policymakers must do more to begin to narrow this gap again. Preventing inequalities due to ill health and disability must be a priority for policy action.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The Lexis surface plot is an established visualization tool in demography. Its present utility, however, is limited to the domain of one-dimensional magnitudes such as rates and counts. Visualizing proportions among three or more groups on a period-age grid is an unsolved problem. OBJECTIVE We seek to extend the Lexis surface plot to the domain of compositional data. METHODS We propose four techniques for visualizing group compositions on a period-age grid. To demonstrate the techniques we use data on age-specific cause-of-death compositions in France from 1925 to 1999. We compare the visualizations for compliance with multiple desired criteria. RESULTS Compositional data can effectively be visualized on the Lexis surface. A key feature of the classical Lexis surface plot – to show age, period, and cohort patterns – is retained in the domain of compositions. The optimal choice among the four proposed techniques depends primarily on the number of groups making up the composition and whether or not the plot should be readable by people with impaired colour vision. CONTRIBUTION We introduce techniques for visualizing compositional data on a period-age grid to the field of demography and demonstrate the usefulness of the techniques by performing an exploratory analysis of age-specific French cause-of-death patterns across the 20th century. We identify strengths and weaknesses of the four proposed techniques. We contribute a technique to construct the ternary-balance colour scheme from within a per- ceptually uniform colour space.},

Model parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood. Although this introduces some challenging identifiability problems and complicates the estimation process it allows a fair comparison of the different models. We propose to solve these identifiability problems by applying two- dimensional constraints over the parameters. Using data from six countries, we compare and rank, both visually and numerically, the models' fitting qualities and develop forecasting models that produce non-diverging, joint mortality rate scenarios. It is found that the CAE model fits best. But we also find that the Li and Lee model potentially suffers from robustness problems when calibrated using maximum likelihood.},

The annuity we examine is the single premium immediate life annuity, an insurance product that pays out a nominal level sum as long as the covered person lives, in exchange for an initial lump-sum premium. This annuity offers protection against the risk of someone outliving his saving, given uncertainty about longevity. For reasonable estimates of behavioral parameters, we calculate that individual annuities are currently priced so that retirees without bequest motives should find these policies of substantial value in configuring their portfolios to smooth retirement consumption. We also find that the expected present discounted value of payouts, relative to the initial cost of the annuity, has increased over the last decade. These findings bear on the policy debate regarding the role of individual choice and self-reliance in retirement planning.},

The MOROP seeks to find a reinsurance program that optimizes two conflicting objectives: the maximization of the expected value of the profit of the company and the minimization of the risk of the insurance losses retained by the company. To calculate these two objectives we built a probabilistic model of the portfolio of risks of the company. This model is embedded within an evolutionary strategy (ES) that approximates the efficient frontier of the MOROP using a combination of four classical reinsurance structures: surplus, quota share, excess-of-loss and stop-loss. Computational experiments with the risks of a specific line of business of a large Colombian general insurance company show that the proposed evolutionary strategy outperforms the classical non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. Moreover, the analysis of the solutions in the efficient frontier obtained with our ES gave several insights to the company in terms of the structure and properties of the solutions for different risk-return trade-offs.},

abstract = {GARCH model has gained popularity during the last two decades, because of their ability to capture non-linear dynamics in the real life data which we often observe especially in financial markets. This paper discuss four common information criteria (AIC, AICc, BIC and HQ) and their ability of correct selection in the presence of GARCH effect, based on their probability of correct selection as a measure of performance. The investigation has been performed using Monte Carlo simulation of conditional variance GARCH processes with six different kinds of DGPs including; GARCH(p, q), p = 1, 2 and q = 1, 2, GARCH(1, 1)-Leverage, and GARCH(1, 1)-Spillover. All these models are further simulated with different parameter combinations to study the possible effect of different volatility structures on these information criteria. We notice an impact from the volatility structure of time series on the performance of these criteria. Specially for higher order GARCH processes, the BIC and HQ criterion select the lower order process at small sample size. Furthermore, we observe different behavior of information criteria for changing the parameter set in higher order case. Moreover, the influence of sample size, having an impact on the the performance of these criteria towards correct selection, is observed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Whereas it is well established that people with a lower socio-economic position have a shorter average lifespan, it is less clear what the variability surrounding these averages is. We set out to examine whether lower educated groups face greater variation in lifespans in addition to having a shorter life expectancy, in order to identify entry points for policies to reduce the impact of socio-economic position on mortality. METHODS We used harmonized, census-based mortality data from 10 European countries to construct life tables by sex and educational level (low, medium, high). Variation in lifespan was measured by the standard deviation conditional upon survival to age 35 years. We also decomposed differences between educational groups in lifespan variation by age and cause of death. RESULTS Lifespan variation was higher among the lower educated in every country, but more so among men and in Eastern Europe. Although there was an inverse relationship between average life expectancy and its standard deviation, the first did not completely predict the latter. Greater lifespan variation in lower educated groups was largely driven by conditions causing death at younger ages, such as injuries and neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS Lower educated individuals not only have shorter life expectancies, but also face greater uncertainty about the age at which they will die. More priority should be given to efforts to reduce the risk of an early death among the lower educated, e.g. by strengthening protective policies within and outside the health-care system.},

These trends are consistent across countries, and apply even to populations with record-low variability in the length of life.

abstract = {We develop a framework for computing the total valuation adjustment (XVA) of a European claim accounting for funding costs, counterparty credit risk, and collateralization. Based on no-arbitrage arguments, we derive backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) associated with the replicating portfolios of long and short positions in the claim. This leads to the definition of buyer's and seller's XVA, which in turn identify a no-arbitrage interval. In the case that borrowing and lending rates coincide, we provide a fully explicit expression for the unique XVA, expressed as a percentage of the price of the traded claim, and for the corresponding replication strategies. In the general case of asymmetric funding, repo and collateral rates, we study the semilinear partial differential equations (PDE) characterizing buyer's and seller's XVA and show the existence of a unique classical solution to it. To illustrate our results, we conduct a numerical study demonstrating how funding costs, repo rates, and counterparty risk contribute to determine the total valuation adjustment.},

When there is a change in mortality rates, the respective surplus (negative reserve) changes for life insurance and annuity policies lead to oppositive sign changes, which provides mortality hedging strategies with a portfolio of life insurance and annuity policies. We first show that by the strategy of matching duration of the weighted surplus at time 0, the surplus changes at time 0 for both portfolios PTP (the n-year term life insurance and the n-year pure endowment) and PWA (the n-payment whole life insurance and the n-year deferred whole life annuity) in response to a proportional or parallel shift in the underlying force of mortality are always negative. Next, we prove that the term life insurance, the whole life insurance and the deferred whole life annuity cannot always form a feasible portfolio (feasibility means that all the weights of the product members of a portfolio are positive) by the strategy of matching two durations or one duration and one convexity of the weighted surplus at time 0.

abstract = {Life expectancy is a measure of how long people are expected to live and is widely used as a measure of human development. Variations in the measure reflect not only the process of ageing but also the impacts of such events as epidemics, wars, and economic recessions. Since 1950, the influence of these events in the most developed countries has waned and life expectancy continues to lengthen unabated. As a result, it has become more difficult to forecast long-run trends accurately, or identify possible upper limits. We present new methods for comparing past improvements in life expectancy and also future prospects, using data from five developed, low-mortality countries. We consider life expectancy in 10-year age intervals rather than over the remaining lifetime, and show how natural limits to life expectancy can be used to extrapolate trends. We discuss the implications and compare our approach with other commonly used methods.},

abstract = {Background: Age of onset of multimorbidity and its prevalence are well documented. However, its contribution to inequalities in life expectancy has yet to be quantified. Methods: A cohort of 1.1 million English people aged 45 and older were followed up from 2001 to 2010. Multimorbidity was defined as having 2 or more of 30 major chronic diseases. Multi-state models were used to estimate years spent healthy and with multimorbidity, stratified by sex, smoking status and quintiles of small-area deprivation. Results: Unequal rates of multimorbidity onset and subsequent survival contributed to higher life expectancy at age 65 for the least (Q1) compared with most (Q5) deprived: There was a 2-year gap in healthy life expectancy for men [Q1: 7.7 years (95{\%} confidence interval: 6.4-8.5) vs Q5: 5.4 (4.4-6.0)] and a 3-year gap for women [Q1: 8.6 (7.5-9.4) vs Q5: 5.9 (4.8-6.4)]; a 1-year gap in life expectancy with multimorbidity for men [Q1: 10.4 (9.9-11.2) vs Q5: 9.1 (8.7-9.6)] but none for women [Q1: 11.6 (11.1-12.4) vs Q5: 11.5 (11.1-12.2)]. Inequalities were attenuated but not fully attributable to socio-economic differences in smoking prevalence: multimorbidity onset was latest for never smokers and subsequent survival was longer for never and ex smokers. Conclusions: The association between social disadvantage and multimorbidity is complex. By quantifying socio-demographic and smoking-related contributions to multimorbidity onset and subsequent survival, we provide evidence for more equitable allocation of prevention and health-care resources to meet local needs.},

abstract = {Background: Because students may purchase food and drinks in and around their schools, the school food environment may be important for obesity-related eating behaviors such as soft drink and snack consumption. However, research exploring the associations between school environments and specific eating behaviors is sparse. Methods: Associations of the availability of canteen food and drinks, the presence of food stores around schools, and individual cognitions (attitudes, norms, modeling, perceived behavioral control, and intentions) with soft drink and snack consumption were examined in a cross-sectional study (2005-2006) among 1293 adolescents aged 12-15 years. Soft drink and snack consumption and related cognitions were assessed with self-administered questionnaires. The presence of food stores and the distance to the nearest food store were calculated within a 500-meter buffer around each school. Data on the availability of soft drinks and snacks in school canteens were gathered by observation. In 2007, multilevel regression models were run to analyze associations and mediation pathways between cognitions, environmental factors, and behaviors. Results: Adolescents' attitudes, subjective norms, parental and peer modeling, and intentions were positively associated with soft drink and snack consumption. There was an inverse association between the distance to the nearest store and the number of small food stores with soft drink consumption. These effects were mediated partly by cognitions. Conclusions: This study provided little evidence for associations of environmental factors in the school environment with soft drink and snack consumption. Individual cognitions appeared to be stronger correlates of intake than physical school-environmental factors. Longitudinal research is needed to confirm these findings.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Counties are the smallest unit for which mortality data are routinely available, allowing consistent and comparable long-term analysis of trends in health disparities. Average life expectancy has steadily increased in the United States but there is limited information on long-term mortality trends in the US counties This study aimed to investigate trends in county mortality and cross-county mortality disparities, including the contributions of specific diseases to county level mortality trends.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: We used mortality statistics (from the National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS]) and population (from the US Census) to estimate sex-specific life expectancy for US counties for every year between 1961 and 1999. Data for analyses in subsequent years were not provided to us by the NCHS. We calculated different metrics of cross-county mortality disparity, and also grouped counties on the basis of whether their mortality changed favorably or unfavorably relative to the national average. We estimated the probability of death from specific diseases for counties with above- or below-average mortality performance. We simulated the effect of cross-county migration on each county's life expectancy using a time-based simulation model. Between 1961 and 1999, the standard deviation (SD) of life expectancy across US counties was at its lowest in 1983, at 1.9 and 1.4 y for men and women, respectively. Cross-county life expectancy SD increased to 2.3 and 1.7 y in 1999. Between 1961 and 1983 no counties had a statistically significant increase in mortality; the major cause of mortality decline for both sexes was reduction in cardiovascular mortality. From 1983 to 1999, life expectancy declined significantly in 11 counties for men (by 1.3 y) and in 180 counties for women (by 1.3 y); another 48 (men) and 783 (women) counties had nonsignificant life expectancy decline. Life expectancy decline in both sexes was caused by increased mortality from lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and a range of other noncommunicable diseases, which were no longer compensated for by the decline in cardiovascular mortality. Higher HIV/AIDS and homicide deaths also contributed substantially to life expectancy decline for men, but not for women. Alternative specifications of the effects of migration showed that the rise in cross-county life expectancy SD was unlikely to be caused by migration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: There was a steady increase in mortality inequality across the US counties between 1983 and 1999, resulting from stagnation or increase in mortality among the worst-off segment of the population. Female mortality increased in a large number of counties, primarily because of chronic diseases related to smoking, overweight and obesity, and high blood pressure.},

For this purpose, we estimate a mortality risk model using a large administrative data set that covers the 1996-2007 period. Besides age and marital status, the model includes as covariates individual and spouse's income as well as a random individual specific effect. It thus allows for dynamic selection based on both observed and unobserved characteristics. We find that conditional on marital status, individual income is about equally strong and negatively associated with mortality risk for men and women and that spouse's income is only weakly associated with mortality risk for women. For both men and women, we quantify remaining life expectancy at age 65 for low-income individuals as approximately 2.5 years less than that for high-income individuals.},

Furthermore, we extend the 1992 Lee-Carter model in such a way that the time-series common risk factor to all cohorts has distinct mortality regimes with different means and volatilities. Finally, we show how to price mortality securities with this model.},

abstract = {In this paper we highlight what we consider to be a lack of adequate conceptualisation, operationalisation and measurement of "place effects". We briefly review recent historical trends in the study of the effects of place on health in industrial countries, and argue that "place effects" often appear to have the status of a residual category, an unspecified black box of somewhat mystical influences on health which remain after investigators have controlled for a range of individual and place characteristics. We note that the distinction between "composition" and "context" may be more apparent than real, and that features of both material infrastructure and collective social functioning may influence health. We suggest using a framework of universal human needs as a basis for thinking about how places may influence health, and recommend the testing of hypotheses about specific chains of causation that might link place of residence with health outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Penalized regression is an attractive framework for variable selection problems. Often, variables possess a grouping structure, and the relevant selection problem is that of selecting groups, not individual variables. The group lasso has been proposed as a way of extending the ideas of the lasso to the problem of group selection. Nonconvex penalties such as SCAD and MCP have been proposed and shown to have several advantages over the lasso; these penalties may also be extended to the group selection problem, giving rise to group SCAD and group MCP methods. Here, we describe algorithms for fitting these models stably and efficiently. In addition, we present simulation results and real data examples comparing and contrasting the statistical properties of these methods.},

The main changes are highlighted and the article explains how figures can be adjusted to take account of these changes so that trends over time can be analysed. The number of deaths assigned to the respiratory disease chapter of the ICD as a whole decreased by 22 per cent as a result of the introduction of ICD-10. Although it is not usually recommended that comparability ratios from the CD-10 bridge-coding study are used to adjust rates prior to 1993, our analysis shows that unadjusted data for 1984 to 1992 can be used to examine longer time trends for respiratory diseases as a whole.},

To determine whether “flipping” a traditional basic pharmaceutics course delivered synchronously to 2 satellite campuses would improve student academic performance, engagement, and perception.Design. In 2012, the basic pharmaceutics course was flipped and delivered to 22 satellite students on 2 different campuses. Twenty-five condensed, recorded course lectures were placed on the course Web site for students to watch prior to class. Scheduled class periods were dedicated to participating in active-learning exercises. Students also completed 2 course projects, 3 midterm examinations, 8 graded quizzes, and a cumulative and comprehensive final examination.Assessment. Results of a survey administered at the beginning and end of the flipped course in 2012 revealed an increase in students' support for learning content prior to class and using class time for more applied learning (p=0.01) and in the belief that learning key foundational content prior to coming to class greatly enhanced in-class learni...},

The interest rates are assumed to follow the recently introduced LIBOR Market Model. The Feynman-Kac theorem provides a PDE model for the spread option pricing problem which is initially posed in an unbounded domain. After a localization procedure and the consideration of appropriate boundary conditions in a bounded domain, we propose a Crank-Nicholson characteristic time discretization scheme combined with a Lagrange piecewise quadratic finite element for the spatial discretization. In order to illustrate the performance of the PDE model and the numerical methods, we present a real example of spread option pricing. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Credit risk has become a topical issue since the 2007 Credit Crisis, particularly for its impact on the valuation of OTC derivatives. This becomes critical when the credit risk of entities involved in a contract either as underlying or counterparty become highly correlated as is the case during macroeconomic shocks. It impacts the valuation of such contracts through an additional term, the credit valuation adjustment (CVA). This can become large with such correlation. This thesis outlines the main approaches to credit risk modelling, intensity and structural. It gives important examples of both and particular examples useful in the calculation of CVA, the intensity model of Brigo and the structural model of Hull and White. It details Brigo's market standard model independent framework for derivatives valuation with CVA. It does this for both its unilateral form where only one counterparty is credit risky and also for its bilateral form where both counterparties are credit risky. This thesis then shows how these frameworks can be applied to the valuation of a credit default swap contract (CDS). Finally, it shows how Brigo's and Hull and White's model for credit risk apply to the valuation of the CVA of CDS and draws comparisons, especially based on their ability to capture correlation effects.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}To improve the design of the pay-out phase of DC plans, this paper proposes a new approach to structure pension products: the Personal Pension with Risk sharing (PPR). By unbundling and valuing the investment, (dis)saving, insurance and risk-sharing functions of pensions, PPRs allow risk management and (dis)saving to be customized to the specific features of heterogeneous individuals. Unlike variable annuities, PPRs allow investment risks to be combined with longevity insurance without giving rise to high year-on-year volatility in consumption streams or opaque and rigid valuation and smoothing rules. The synthesis of a PPR structure provides new opportunities for product innovation and for the comparison of retirement products.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We analyze a pooled annuity fund from a participant's perspective by comparing it to a mortality-linked fund, a type of variable payout life annuity, that gives a return linked to the force of mortality but subject to a cost. Fixing the instantaneous volatility of return on wealth, we find that the expected return on the pooled annuity fund is higher except when the costs are very low in the mortality-linked fund. Similar results are obtained when maximizing the expected lifetime utility of consumption, assuming a constant relative risk aversion utility function. In both settings, our results indicate that a participant may be willing to accept the mortality risk of the pooled annuity fund, even when only 100 individuals are pooling their mortality in the pooled annuity fund. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} In this paper, we project future mortality rates for actuarial use with Chinese data using a modified Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) Mortality Projections Model. The model adopts a convergence structure from “initial” to “long-term” rates of mortality improvement as the process of projection. The initial rates of mortality improvement are derived using two-dimensional P-spline methodology. Given the short history of Chinese data, the long-term rates of mortality improvement are determined by borrowing information from international experience. K-means clustering with dynamic time warping distance is used to classify populations, which is novel in the actuarial mortality research field. The original CMI approach is deterministic, however, in this paper we make it stochastic using techniques outlined by Koller and described by Browne {\textless}italic{\textgreater}et al{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} . Comparing our results with a pure extrapolative approach, we find that the CMI Mortality Projections Model is more suitable for long-term projections for China. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global and regional projections of mortality and burden of disease by cause for the years 2000, 2010, and 2030 were published by Murray and Lopez in 1996 as part of the Global Burden of Disease project. These projections, which are based on 1990 data, continue to be widely quoted, although they are substantially outdated; in particular, they substantially underestimated the spread of HIV/AIDS. To address the widespread demand for information on likely future trends in global health, and thereby to support international health policy and priority setting, we have prepared new projections of mortality and burden of disease to 2030 starting from World Health Organization estimates of mortality and burden of disease for 2002. This paper describes the methods, assumptions, input data, and results. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Relatively simple models were used to project future health trends under three scenarios-baseline, optimistic, and pessimistic-based largely on projections of economic and social development, and using the historically observed relationships of these with cause-specific mortality rates. Data inputs have been updated to take account of the greater availability of death registration data and the latest available projections for HIV/AIDS, income, human capital, tobacco smoking, body mass index, and other inputs. In all three scenarios there is a dramatic shift in the distribution of deaths from younger to older ages and from communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional causes to noncommunicable disease causes. The risk of death for children younger than 5 y is projected to fall by nearly 50{\%} in the baseline scenario between 2002 and 2030. The proportion of deaths due to noncommunicable disease is projected to rise from 59{\%} in 2002 to 69{\%} in 2030. Global HIV/AIDS deaths are projected to rise from 2.8 million in 2002 to 6.5 million in 2030 under the baseline scenario, which assumes coverage with antiretroviral drugs reaches 80{\%} by 2012. Under the optimistic scenario, which also assumes increased prevention activity, HIV/AIDS deaths are projected to drop to 3.7 million in 2030. Total tobacco-attributable deaths are projected to rise from 5.4 million in 2005 to 6.4 million in 2015 and 8.3 million in 2030 under our baseline scenario. Tobacco is projected to kill 50{\%} more people in 2015 than HIV/AIDS, and to be responsible for 10{\%} of all deaths globally. The three leading causes of burden of disease in 2030 are projected to include HIV/AIDS, unipolar depressive disorders, and ischaemic heart disease in the baseline and pessimistic scenarios. Road traffic accidents are the fourth leading cause in the baseline scenario, and the third leading cause ahead of ischaemic heart disease in the optimistic scenario. Under the baseline scenario, HIV/AIDS becomes the leading cause of burden of disease in middle- and low-income countries by 2015. CONCLUSIONS: These projections represent a set of three visions of the future for population health, based on certain explicit assumptions. Despite the wide uncertainty ranges around future projections, they enable us to appreciate better the implications for health and health policy of currently observed trends, and the likely impact of fairly certain future trends, such as the ageing of the population, the continued spread of HIV/AIDS in many regions, and the continuation of the epidemiological transition in developing countries. The results depend strongly on the assumption that future mortality trends in poor countries will have a relationship to economic and social development similar to those that have occurred in the higher-income countries.},

The collection and use of digital data also presents numerous statistical, computational, and ethical challenges, motivating the development of new research approaches to address these burgeoning issues. In this article, we argue that researchers with formal training in demography – who have a history of developing innovative approaches to using challenging data – are well positioned to contribute to this area of work. We discuss the benefits and challenges of using digital trace data for social and demographic research, and review examples of current demographic literature that creatively utilizes digital trace data to study processes related to fertility, mortality and migration. Focusing on Facebook data for advertisers –a novel, ‘digital census' that has largely been untapped by demographers – we provide illustrative and empirical examples of how demographic researchers can manage issues such as bias and representation when using digital trace data. We conclude by offering our perspective on the road ahead regarding demography and its role in the ‘data revolution.'},

abstract = {Age-specific mortality rates are often disaggregated by different attributes, such as sex, state and ethnicity. Forecasting age-specific mortality rates at the national and sub-national levels plays an important role in developing social policy. However, independent forecasts at the sub-national levels may not add up to the forecasts at the national level. To address this issue, we consider reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates, extending the methods of Hyndman et al. (2011) to functional time series, where age is considered as a continuum. The grouped functional time series methods are used to produce point forecasts of mortality rates that are aggregated appropriately across different disaggregation factors. For evaluating forecast uncertainty, we propose a bootstrap method for reconciling interval forecasts. Using the regional age-specific mortality rates in Japan, obtained from the Japanese Mortality Database, we investigate the one- to ten-step-ahead point and interval forecast accuracies between the independent and grouped functional time series forecasting methods. The proposed methods are shown to be useful for reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates at the national and sub-national levels. They also enjoy improved forecast accuracy averaged over different disaggregation factors. Supplemental materials for the article are available online.},

Relative rates of mortality and relative indices of inequality were calculated from 21 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Mortality risk was similar at each stage of life, with men in the higher social classes having the lowest risk. Social class at screening produced the greatest relative indices of inequality.

Synthesis was by random-effects meta-analysis, and variation between studies was investigated by meta-regression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: Low- and middle-income countries.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPARTICIPANTS: 13 studies were included in the meta-analysis, 11 from low-income and two from middle-income countries and none were from remote areas.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures of interest were perinatal, neonatal, infant and child mortality.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Overall, children who lived farthest from health facilities were more likely to die compared with those who lived closer (OR 1.32, 95{\%} CI 1.19 to 1.47). This effect appeared stronger during the perinatal (OR 2.76, 95{\%} CI 1.80 to 4.24) and neonatal (OR 1.98, 95{\%} CI 1.43 to 2.72) periods compared with the infant (OR 1.18, 95{\%} CI 1.0 to 1.38) and under-5 (OR 1.20, 95{\%} CI 1.04 to 1.39) periods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Proximity to health facilities appears to be an important determinant of under-5 mortality in low- and middle-income countries, especially in the perinatal and neonatal periods. Higher quality studies are needed, which examine the effect of access to health services on child survival, especially studies from remote areas and hard to reach populations.},

abstract = {This and the follow-up paper deal with the valuation and hedging of bilateral counterparty risk on over-the-counter derivatives. Our study is done in a multiple-curve setup reflecting the various funding constraints (or costs) involved, allowing one to investigate the question of interaction between bilateral counterparty risk and funding. The first task is to define a suitable notion of no arbitrage price in the presence of various funding costs. This is the object of this paper, where we develop an “additive, multiple curve” extension of the classical “multiplicative (discounted), one curve” risk-neutral pricing approach. We derive the dynamic hedging interpretation of such an “additive risk-neutral” price, starting by consistency with pricing by replication in the case of a complete market. This is illustrated by a completely solved example building over previous work by Burgard and Kjaer.},

abstract = {In the absence of individual data, ecological or contextual measures of socioeconomic level are frequently used to describe social inequalities in health. This work focuses on the methodological aspects of the development and validation of a French small-area index of socioeconomic deprivation and its application to the evaluation of the socioeconomic differentials in health outcomes. This index was derived from a principal component analysis of 1999 national census data from the Strasbourg metropolitan area in eastern France, at the census block level. Composed of 19 variables that reflect the multiple aspects of socioeconomic status (income, employment, housing, family and household, and educational level), it can discriminate disadvantaged urban centres from more privileged rural and suburban areas. Several statistical tests (Cronbach's alpha coefficient, convergent validity tests with other deprivation indices from the literature) provided internal and external validation. Its successful application to another French metropolitan area (Lille, in northern France) confirmed its transposability. Finally, its capacity to capture the social inequalities in health when applied to myocardial infarction data shows its potential value. This study thus provides a new tool in French public health research for characterising neighbourhood deprivation and detecting socioeconomic disparities in the distribution of health outcomes at the small-area level.},

The paper offers guidelines, a perception-based color space alternative to the famous RGB color space and several tools to more effectively convey graphical information to viewers. Results of many atmospheric science applications are processed graphically. Visualizations are a powerful tool to display and communicate (complex) data. But to create effective figures wide scopes of challenges have to be considered. Therefore, this paper offers several guidelines with a focus on colors. Colors are often used to add additional information or to code information. Colors should (i) allow humans to process the information rapidly, (ii) guide the reader to the most important information, and (iii) represent the data appropriately without misleading distortion. The second and third requirements necessitate tailoring the visualization, and the use of colors, to the specific purpose of the graphic. A standard way of deriving color palettes is via trans...},

The use of index-based hedges gives rise to basis risk, but benefits, potentially, from lower costs to the hedger and greater liquidity. We focus on quantification of optimal hedge ratios and hedge effectiveness and investigate how robust these quantities are relative to inclusion of recalibration risk, parameter uncertainty, and Poisson risk. We find that strategies are robust relative to the inclusion of parameter uncertainty and Poisson risk. In contrast, single-instrument hedging strategies are found to lack robustness relative to the inclusion of recalibration risk at the future valuation date, although we also demonstrate that some hedging instruments are more robust than others. To address this problem, we develop multi-instrument hedging strategies that are robust relative to recalibration risk.},

@article{Prem2020,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel strain of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak. METHODS: We quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in Wuhan, China, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. We included the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. Further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. Lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak. FINDINGS: Changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92{\%} (interquartile range: 66-97{\%}). There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of reducing the height of the peak, overall epidemic size in mid-2020 and probability that a second peak may occur after return to work. However, the modelled effects of social distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children play in the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would likely contribute to the reduction and delay the epidemic size and peak, respectively. However, there are some limitations to the analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. {\#}{\#}{\#} Funding Statement KP, YL, MJ, and PK were funded by the Bill {\&} Melinda Gates Foundation (grant number INV-003174), YL and MJ were funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) (16/137/109), TWR and AJK were funded by the Wellcome Trust (grant number 206250/Z/17/Z), RME was funded by HDR UK (grant number MR/S003975/1), and ND was funded by NIHR (HPRU-2012-10096).This research was partly funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) (16/137/109) using UK aid from the UK Government to support global health research.

abstract = {Rapid population ageing in China has urged the need to understand health transitions of older Chinese to assist the development of social security programmes and financial products aimed at funding long-term care. In this paper, we develop a new flexible approach to modelling health transitions in a multi-state Markov model that allows for age effects, time trends and age-time interactions. The model is implemented in the generalised linear modelling framework. We apply the model to evaluate health transitions of Chinese elderly using individual-level panel data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey for the period 1998–2012. Our results confirm that time trends and age–time interactions are important factors explaining health transitions in addition to the more commonly used age effects. We document that differences in disability and mortality rates continue to persist between urban and rural older Chinese. We also compute life expectancies and healthy life expectancies based on the proposed model as inputs for the development of aged care and financial services for older Chinese.},

abstract = {This article introduces this JBR Special Issue on simple versus complex methods in forecasting. Simplicity in forecasting requires that (1) method, (2) representation of cumulative knowledge, (3) relationships in models, and (4) relationships among models, forecasts, and decisions are all sufficiently uncomplicated as to be easily understood by decision-makers. Our review of studies comparing simple and complex methods - including those in this special issue - found 97 comparisons in 32 papers. None of the papers provide a balance of evidence that complexity improves forecast accuracy. Complexity increases forecast error by 27 percent on average in the 25 papers with quantitative comparisons. The finding is consistent with prior research to identify valid forecasting methods: all 22 previously identified evidence-based forecasting procedures are simple. Nevertheless, complexity remains popular among researchers, forecasters, and clients. Some evidence suggests that the popularity of complexity may be due to incentives: (1) researchers are rewarded for publishing in highly ranked journals, which favor complexity; (2) forecasters can use complex methods to provide forecasts that support decision-makers' plans; and (3) forecasters' clients may be reassured by incomprehensibility. Clients who prefer accuracy should accept forecasts only from simple evidence-based procedures. They can rate the simplicity of forecasters' procedures using the questionnaire at simple-forecasting.com.},

@techreport{Mayhew2018,
abstract = {This research investigates the impact of deprivation on demographic inequalities in England. Using a range of demographic measures including the modal age at death, life expectancy, lifespan variation and mortality, it shows that each is negatively correlated with deprivation as measured by the 2015 Index of Multiple Deprivation, i.e. the more deprived a group of the population or a particular area is, the worse are the demographic outcomes. Although it finds that life expectancy is increasing overall and that life expectancies of men and women are converging, any improvements are slower paced in more deprived areas with the net effect that the gap between rich and poor is slowly worsening over time. In general, men are more adversely impacted by deprivation than women with the gap in life expectancy at age 30 between the top and bottom 1{\%} of deprived neighbourhoods at 10.9 years for men and 8.4 years for women. Inequalities in male mortality rates at age 44 are 4.4 times in the most deprived 10{\%} of neighbourhoods than those in the 10{\%} least deprived, and are much higher than in more moderately deprived intervening deciles. The basic pattern shows that the southeast is less affected than the rest of the country. However, the worst deprivation is concentrated in specific areas. For example, in 22 out of 326 English districts 25{\%} or more of neighbourhoods are in the most deprived 10{\%} and in 5 districts it is 40{\%} or above. It is argued that much of the differences can be explained by the adoption of unhealthy lifestyles and a lack of social mobility and investment.},

abstract = {Due to the inherent non-linearity and non-stationary characteristics of financial stock market price time series, conventional modeling techniques such as the Box-Jenkins autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) are not adequate for stock market price forecasting. In this paper, a forecasting model based on chaotic mapping, firefly algorithm, and support vector regression (SVR) is proposed to predict stock market price. The forecasting model has three stages. In the first stage, a delay coordinate embedding method is used to reconstruct unseen phase space dynamics. In the second stage, a chaotic firefly algorithm is employed to optimize SVR hyperparameters. Finally in the third stage, the optimized SVR is used to forecast stock market price. The significance of the proposed algorithm is 3-fold. First, it integrates both chaos theory and the firefly algorithm to optimize SVR hyperparameters, whereas previous studies employ a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize these parameters. Second, it uses a delay coordinate embedding method to reconstruct phase space dynamics. Third, it has high prediction accuracy due to its implementation of structural risk minimization (SRM). To show the applicability and superiority of the proposed algorithm, we selected the three most challenging stock market time series data from NASDAQ historical quotes, namely Intel, National Bank shares and Microsoft daily closed (last) stock price, and applied the proposed algorithm to these data. Compared with genetic algorithm-based SVR (SVR-GA), chaotic genetic algorithm-based SVR (SVR-CGA), firefly-based SVR (SVR-FA), artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), the proposed model performs best based on two error measures, namely mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute percent error (MAPE).

@article{Haugh2010,
abstract = {One of the principal disadvantages of short rate models, and HJM models more generally, is that they focus on unobservable instantaneous interest rates. The so-called market models that were developed1 in the late 90's overcome this problem by directly modeling observable market rates such as LIBOR2 and swap rates. These models are straightforward to calibrate and have quickly gained widespread acceptance from practitioners. The first market models were actually developed in the HJM framework where the dynamics of instantaneous forward rates are used via Itˆ bond prices were then used, again via Itˆ o's Lemma to determine the dynamics of zero-coupon bonds. The dynamics of zero coupon o's Lemma, to determine the dynamics of LIBOR. Market models are therefore not inconsistent with HJM models. In these lecture notes, however, we will prefer to specify the market models directly rather than derive them in the HJM framework. In the process, we will derive Black's formulae for caplets and swaptions thereby demonstrating the consistency of these formulae with martingale pricing theory. Throughout these notes, we will ignore the possibility of default or counter-party risk and treat LIBOR interest rates as the fundamental rates in the market. Zero-coupon bond prices are then computed using LIBOR rather than the default-free rates implied by the prices of government securities. This does result in a minor inconsistency in that we price derivative securities assuming no possibility of default yet the interest rates themselves that play the role of “underlying security”, i.e. LIBOR and swap rates, implicitly incorporate the possibility of default. This inconsistency actually occurs in practice when banks trade caps, swaps and other instruments with each other, and ignore the possibility of default when quoting prices. Instead, the associated credit risks are kept to a minimum through the use of netting agreements and by counter-parties limiting the total size of trades they conduct with one another. This approach can also be justified when counter-parties have a similar credit rating and similar exposures to one another. Finally, we should mention that it is indeed possible3, and sometimes necessary, to explicitly model credit risk even when we are pricing ‘standard' securities such as caps and swaps. It goes without saying of course, that default risk needs to be modeled explicitly when pricing credit derivatives and related securities. Spring 2010},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Insurance companies and pension funds must value liabilities using mortality rates that are appropriate for their portfolio. These can only be estimated in a reliable way from a sufficiently large historical dataset for such portfolios, which is often not available. We overcome this problem by introducing a model to estimate portfolio-specific mortality simultaneously with population mortality. By using a Bayesian framework, we automatically generate the appropriate weighting for the limited statistical information in a given portfolio and the more extensive information that is available for the whole population. This allows us to separate parameter uncertainty from uncertainty due to the randomness in individual deaths for a given realization of mortality rates. When we apply our method to a dataset of assured lives in England and Wales, we find that different prior specifications for the portfolio-specific factors lead to significantly different posterior distributions for hazard rates. However, in short-term predictive distributions for future numbers of deaths, individual mortality risk turns out to be more important than parameter uncertainty in the portfolio-specific factors, both for large and for small portfolios.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in prevalence of disability over age 70 have widened or narrowed during the past 2 decades. METHODS: We used data from the 1982-2002 National Health Interview Surveys, which are nationally representative cross-sectional surveys of the noninstitutionalized population of the United States. Participants included 172227 people aged 70 years and older. The primary outcome measure was the average annual percentage change in the prevalence of 2 self-reported disability measures: the need for help with activities of daily living ("ADL disability") and need for help with either ADL or instrumental activities of daily living ("any disability"). RESULTS: All groups experienced declines in the age- and gender-adjusted prevalence of any disability during the 1982 to 2002 period. However, the average annual percent declines were smaller for the least advantaged socioeconomic groups. Differences in trends across racial/ethnic groups were not statistically significant. ADL disability prevalence decreased for the more advantaged groups but increased among the lowest income and education groups. Non-Hispanic Whites and minorities experienced similar average annual percent declines in ADL disability. CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic disparities in old-age disability have persisted over the last 20 years, whereas socioeconomic disparities have increased.},

Most regularization strategies only work for data where all predictors are of the same type, such as Lasso regression for continuous predictors. However, many predictive problems involve different predictor types. We propose a multi-type Lasso penalty that acts on the objective function as a sum of subpenalties, one for each predictor type. As such, we perform predictor selection and level fusion within a predictor in a data-driven way, simultaneous with the parameter estimation process. We develop a new estimation strategy for convex predictive models with this multi-type penalty. Using the theory of proximal operators, our estimation procedure is computationally efficient, partitioning the overall optimization problem into easier to solve subproblems, specific for each predictor type and its associated penalty. The proposed SMuRF algorithm improves on existing solvers in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This is demonstrated with an extensive simulation study and the analysis of a case-study on insurance pricing analytics.},

abstract = {We review the topic of stochastic epidemic modeling with emphasis on compartmental stochastic models. A main theme is the usefulness of the correspondence between these and their large population deterministic limits, which describe dynamical systems. The dynamics of an ODE system informs us of the deterministic skeleton upon which the behavior of corresponding stochastic systems are built. In this chapter we present a number of examples, mostly in the context of susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) models, and point out how this way of thinking may be useful in understanding other stochastic models. In particular we discuss the distribution of final epidemic size, the effect of different patterns of infectiousness, and the quantification of stochastically sustained oscillations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Netherlands.},

abstract = {Driven by technological progress, human life expectancy has increased greatly since the nineteenth century. Demographic evidence has revealed an ongoing reduction in old-age mortality and a rise of the maximum age at death, which may gradually extend human longevity 1,2 . Together with observations that lifespan in various animal species is flexible and can be increased by genetic or pharmaceutical intervention, these results have led to suggestions that longevity may not be subject to strict, species-specific genetic constraints. Here, by analysing global demographic data, we show that improvements in survival with age tend to decline after age 100, and that the age at death of the world's oldest person has not increased since the 1990s. Our results strongly suggest that the maximum lifespan of humans is fixed and subject to natural constraints. Maximum lifespan is, in contrast to average lifespan, generally assumed to be a stable characteristic of a species 3 . For humans, the maximum reported age at death is generally set at 122 years, the age at death of Jeanne Calment, still the oldest documented human individual who ever lived 4 . However, some evidence suggests that maximum lifespan is not fixed. Studies in model organisms have shown that maximum lifespan is flexible and can be affected by genetic and pharmacological interventions 5 . In Sweden, based on a long series of reliable information on the upper limits of human lifespan, the maximum reported age at death was found to have risen from about 101 years during the 1860s to about 108 years during the 1990s 6 . According to the authors, this finding refutes the common assertion that human lifespan is fixed and unchanging over time 6 . Indeed, the most convincing argument that the maximum lifespan of humans is not fixed is the ongoing increase in life expectancy in most countries over the course of the last century 1,2 . Figure 1a shows this increase for France, a country with high-quality mortality data, but very similar patterns were found for most other developed nations (Extended Data Fig. 1). Hence, the possibility has been considered that mortality may decline further, breaking any pre-conceived boundaries of human lifespan 1,7 . As shown by data from the Human Mortality Database 8 , many of the historical gains in life expectancy have been attributed to a reduction in early-life mortality. More recent data, however, show evidence for a decline in late-life mortality, with the fraction of each birth cohort reaching old age increasing with calendar year. In France, the number of individuals per 100,000 surviving to old age (70 and up) has increased since 1900 (Fig. 1b), which points towards a continuing increase in human life expectancy. This pattern is very similar across the other 40 countries and territories included in the database (Extended Data Figs 2, 3). However, the rate of improvement in survival peaks and then declines for very old age levels (Fig. 1c), which points},

These advances are based on a modern approach to designing, fitting and applying neural networks, generally referred to as "Deep Learning". This paper investigates how actuarial science may adapt and evolve in the coming years to incorporate these new techniques and methodologies. After providing some background on machine learning and deep learning, and providing a heuristic for where actuaries might benefit from applying these techniques, the paper surveys emerging applications of artificial intelligence in actuarial science, with examples from mortality modelling, claims reserving, non-life pricing and telematics. For some of the examples, code has been provided on GitHub so that the interested reader can experiment with these techniques for themselves. The paper concludes with an outlook on the potential for actuaries to integrate deep learning into their activities.},

abstract = {One of the most widely used standard procedures for model evaluation in classification and regression is K-fold cross-validation (CV). However, when it comes to time series forecasting, because of the inherent serial correlation and potential non-stationarity of the data, its application is not straightforward and often replaced by practitioners in favour of an out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation. It is shown that for purely autoregressive models, the use of standard K-fold CV is possible provided the models considered have uncorrelated errors. Such a setup occurs, for example, when the models nest a more appropriate model. This is very common when Machine Learning methods are used for prediction, and where CV can control for overfitting the data. Theoretical insights supporting these arguments are presented, along with a simulation study and a real-world example. It is shown empirically that K-fold CV performs favourably compared to both OOS evaluation and other time-series-specific techniques such as non-dependent cross-validation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To systematically compare midlife mortality patterns in the United States across racial and ethnic groups during 1999-2016, documenting causes of death and their relative contribution to excess deaths. DESIGN Trend analysis of US vital statistics among racial and ethnic groups. SETTING United States, 1999-2016. POPULATION US adults aged 25-64 years (midlife). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Absolute changes in mortality measured as average year-to-year change during 1999-2016 and 2012-16; excess deaths attributable to increasing mortality; and relative changes in mortality measured as relative difference between mortality in 1999 versus 2016 and the nadir year versus 2016, and the slope of modeled mortality trends for 1999-2016 and for intervals between joinpoints. RESULTS During 1999-2016, all cause mortality in midlife increased not only among non-Hispanic (NH) whites but also among NH American Indians and Alaskan Natives. Although all cause mortality initially decreased among NH blacks, Hispanics, and NH Asians and Pacific Islanders, this trend ended in 2009-11. Drug overdoses were the leading cause of increased mortality in midlife in each population, but mortality also increased for alcohol related conditions, suicides, and organ diseases involving multiple body systems. Although midlife mortality among NH whites increased across a multitude of conditions, a similar trend affected non-white populations. Absolute (year-to-year) increases in midlife mortality among non-white populationsoften matched or exceeded those of NH whites, especially in 2012-16, when the rate of increase intensified for many causes of death. During 1999-2016, NH American Indians and Alaskan Natives experienced large increases in midlife mortality from 12 causes, not only drug overdoses (411.4{\%}) but also hypertensive diseases (269.3{\%}), liver cancer (115.1{\%}), viral hepatitis (112.1{\%}), and diseases of the nervous system (99.8{\%}). NH blacks experienced increased midlife mortality from 17 causes, including drug overdoses (149.6{\%}), homicides (21.4{\%}), hypertensive diseases (15.5{\%}), obesity (120.7{\%}), and liver cancer (49.5{\%}). NH blacks also experienced retrogression: after a period of stable or declining midlife mortality early in 1999-2016, death rates increased for alcohol related liver disease, chronic lower respiratory tract disease, suicides, diabetes, and pancreatic cancer. Among Hispanics, midlife mortality increased across 12 causes, including drug overdoses (80.0{\%}), hypertensive diseases (40.6{\%}), liver cancer (41.8{\%}), suicides (21.9{\%}), obesity (106.6{\%}), and metabolic disorders (60.0{\%}). Retrogression also occurred in this population; after a period of declining mortality, death rates increased for alcohol related liver disease, mental and behavioral disorders involving psychoactive substances, and homicides. NH Asians and Pacific Islanders were least affected by this trend but also experienced increases in midlife mortality from drug overdoses (300.6{\%}), alcohol related liver disease (62.9{\%}), hypertensive diseases (28.3{\%}), and brain cancer (56.6{\%}). The suicide rate in this group increased by 29.7{\%} after 2001. The relative increase in US midlife mortality differed by sex and geography. For example, the relative increase in fatal drug overdoses was greater among women than among men. Although the relative increase in midlife mortality was generally greater in non-metropolitan (ie, rural) areas, the relative increase in drug overdoses among NH whites and Hispanics was greatest in suburban fringe areas of large cities, and among NH blacks was greatest in small cities. CONCLUSIONS Mortality in midlife in the US has increased across racial-ethnic populations for a variety of conditions, especially in recent years, offsetting years of progress in lowering mortality rates. This reversal carries added consequences for racial groups with high baseline mortality rates, such as for NH blacks and NH American Indians and Alaskan Natives. That death rates are increasing throughout the US population for dozens of conditions signals a systemic cause and warrants prompt action by policy makers to tackle the factors responsible for declining health in the US.},

There are different ways of simulating, either in a linear parallel structure or in a branching tree structure. We then discuss the initial conditions required, which may be market conditions at some date, or may be “neutral” initial conditions, which may be defined in different ways. One method of generating initial conditions would be to simulate them randomly, from their own long-term distribution, and we show how to calculate the means, variances and covariances of these. What we call “neutralising parameters” may have a role, and we discuss how these may be found. Finally, we suggest using additional information in the first periods of the simulation to adjust the formulae or parameters for a limited “select period”.},

abstract = {Although Denmark and Sweden have close cultural and historical ties, lifespans for Danes have generally been lower than those of Swedes. Recent improvements in Danish mortality after a period of stagnation have led to the suspicion that there may be positive trends at the very high ages at death within that population and that these trends could be quite different from those observed in Sweden. Although the mean ages at death for Danish and Swedish centenarians have been relatively constant at about 102 years for the cohorts born 1870–1904, the oldest-old in Denmark have been getting older, but no evidence has suggested any increase in lifespan for Swedes. Using quantile regression, we show that Danish centenarian lifespans in the 90th percentile have been lengthening, with those in 94th percentile (6 {\%} longest-lived individuals) having a trend that is statistically significant at the 5 {\%} level. We demonstrate that the increase observed is not due to the increasing sizes of birth cohorts and thus must be due to improving survival among this select top tier. We postulate that this super-select group in Denmark is best able to take advantage of the factors driving mortality reduction, whereas the majority of centenarians are not.},

abstract = {Symbolic data analysis has been proposed as a technique for summarising large and complex datasets into a much smaller and tractable number of distributions -- such as random rectangles or histograms -- each describing a portion of the larger dataset. Recent work has developed likelihood-based methods that permit fitting models for the underlying data while only observing the distributional summaries. However, while powerful, when working with random histograms this approach rapidly becomes computationally intractable as the dimension of the underlying data increases. We introduce a composite-likelihood variation of this likelihood-based approach for the analysis of random histograms in {\$}K{\$} dimensions, through the construction of lower-dimensional marginal histograms. The performance of this approach is examined through simulated and real data analysis of max-stable models for spatial extremes using millions of observed datapoints in more than {\$}K=100{\$} dimensions. Large computational savings are available compared to existing model fitting approaches.},

abstract = {This article provides a formal analysis of payout adjustments from a longevity risk-pooling fund, an arrangement we refer to as group self-annuitization (GSA). The distinguishing risk diffusion characteristic of GSAs in the family of longevity insurance instruments is that the annuitants bear their systematic risk, but the pool shares idiosyncratic risk. This obviates the need for an insurance company, although such instruments could be sold through a corporate insurer. We begin by deriving the payout adjustment for a single entry group with a single annuity factor and constant expectations. We then show that under weak requirements a unique solution to payout paths exists when multiple cohorts combine into a single pool. This relies on the harmonic mean of the ratio of realized to expected survivorship rates across cohorts. The case of evolving expectations is also analyzed. In all cases, we demonstrate that the periodic-benefit payment in a pooled annuity fund is determined based on the previous payment adjusted for any deviations in mortality and interest from expectations. GSA may have considerable appeal in countries which have adopted national defined contribution schemes and/or in which the life insurance industry is noncompetitive or poorly developed.},

abstract = {Older Americans have experienced dramatic gains in life expectancy in recent decades, but an emerging literature reveals that these gains are accumulating mostly to those at the top of the income distribution. We explore how growing inequality in life expectancy affects lifetime benefits from Social Security, Medicare, and other programs and how this phenomenon interacts with possible program reforms. We first project that life expectancy at age 50 for males in the two highest income quintiles will rise by 7 to 8 years between the 1930 and 1960 birth cohorts, but that the two lowest income quintiles will experience little to no increase over that time period. This divergence in life expectancy will cause the gap between average lifetime program benefits received by men in the highest and lowest quintiles to widen by {\$}130,000 (in {\$}2009) over this period. Finally we simulate the effect of Social Security reforms such as raising the normal retirement age and changing the benefit formula to see whether they mitigate or enhance the reduced progressivity resulting from the widening gap in life expectancy.},

abstract = {Background: Since 2010, the rate of improvement in life expectancy in the UK has slowed. We aimed to put this trend in the context of changes over the long term and in relation to a group of other high-income countries. Methods: We compared sex-specific trends in life expectancy since 1970 and age-specific mortality in England and Wales with median values for 22 high-income countries (in western Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, and the USA). We used annual mortality data (1970–2016) from the Human Mortality Database. Findings: Until 2011–16, male life expectancy in England and Wales followed the median life expectancy of the comparator group. By contrast, female life expectancy was below the median and is among the lowest of the countries considered. In 2011–16, the rate of improvement in life expectancy slowed sharply for both sexes in England and Wales, and slowed more moderately in the comparator group because of negative trends in all adult age groups. This deceleration resulted in a widening gap between England and Wales and the comparators from 2011 onwards. Since the mid-2000s, for the first time, mortality rates in England and Wales among people aged 25–50 years were appreciably higher than in the comparator group. Interpretation: Although many countries have seen slower increases in life expectancy since 2011, trends in England and Wales are among the worst. The poor performance of female life expectancy over the long-term is in part driven by the relative timing of the smoking epidemic across countries. The previously overlooked higher mortality among young working-age adults in England and Wales relative to other countries deserves urgent attention. Funding: None.},

abstract = {Background: Reducing lifespan inequality is increasingly recognized as a health policy objective. Whereas lifespan inequality declined with rising longevity in most developed countries, Danish life expectancy stagnated between 1975 and 1995 for females and progressed slowly for males. It is unknown how Danish lifespan inequality changed, which causes of death drove these developments, and where the opportunities for further improvements lie now. Methods: We present an analytical strategy based on cause-by-age decompositions to simultaneously analyze changes in Danish life expectancy and lifespan inequality from 1960 to 2014, as well as current Swedish-Danish differences. Results: Stagnation in Danish life expectancy coincided with a shorter period of stagnation in lifespan inequality (1975-1990). The stagnation in life expectancy was mainly driven by increases in cancer and non-infectious respiratory mortality at higher ages (-.63 years) offsetting a reduction in cardiovascular and infant mortality (+ 1.52 years). Lifespan inequality stagnated because most causes of death did not show compression over the time period. Both these observations were consistent with higher smoking-related mortality in Danes born in 1919-1939. After 1995, life expectancy and lifespan equality increased in lockstep, but still lag behind Sweden, mainly due to infant mortality and cancer. Conclusions: Since 1960, Danish improvements in life expectancy and lifespan equality were halted by smoking-related mortality in those born 1919-1939, while also reductions in old-age cardiovascular mortality held back lifespan equality. The comparison with Sweden suggests that Denmark can reduce inequality in lifespans and increase life expectancy through a consistent policy target: reducing cancer and infant mortality.},

abstract = {Where mortality projection is concerned, it is essential to quantify the extent of the prediction error. This is especially important in light of the aggravating risk of longevity and as a result the increasing demand for longevity-linked products. In the literature so far, only parameter error and process error have been considered jointly while the issue of model error has yet been systematically studied. In this paper, we propose a method to account for process error, parameter error and model error in an integrated manner by modifying the semi-parametric bootstrapping technique. We apply the method to two data sets from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) and use the simulated scenarios to price the q-forward contracts via the maximum entropy approach. We find that model selection has a significant impact on the risk-neutral valuation results and thus it is crucial to incorporate model error in mortality projection.},

In its aggregate form, the systematic risk of changes to general mortality patterns, it has the potential for causing large cumulative losses for insurers. Since obvious risk management tools, such as (re)insurance or hedging, are less suited for managing an annuity provider's exposure to this risk, we propose a type of life annuity with benefits contingent on actual mortality experience. Similar adaptations to conventional product design exist with investment-linked annuities, and a role model for long-term contracts contingent on actual cost experience can be found in German private health insurance. By effectively sharing systematic longevity risk with policyholders, insurers may avoid cumulative losses. Policyholders also gain in comparison with a comparable conventional annuity product: Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we identify a significant upside potential for policyholders while downside risk is limited.},

abstract = {A health risk score was created to investigate the possibility of using data provided by wearable technology to help predict overall health and mortality, with the ultimate goal of using this score to enhance the pricing of health or life insurance. Subjects were categorized into low-, increased-, and high- risk groups, and after results were adjusted for age and sex, Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed a high level of significancewhen predictingmortality. High-risk subjects were shown to have a hazard ratio of 2.1 relative to those in the low-risk group, which can be interpreted as an equivalent increase in age of 7.8 years. Our findings help to demonstrate the predictive capabilities of potential new rating factors, measured via wearables, that could feasibly be incorporated into actuarial insurance pricing models. The model also provides an initial step for insurers to begin to consider the incorporation of continuous wearable data into current risk models. With this in mind, an emphasis is placed on the limitations of the study in order to highlight the areas that must be addressed before incorporating aspects of this model within current pricing models.},

abstract = {The pricing of longevity-linked securities depends not only on the stochastic uncer-tainty of the underlying risk factors, but also the attitude of investors towards those factors. In this research, we investigate how to estimate the market risk premium of longevity risk using investable retirement indexes, incorporating uncertain real inter-est rates using an affine dynamic Nelson-Siegel model. A multi-cohort aggregate, or systematic, continuous time affine mortality model is used where each risk factor is assigned a market price of mortality risk. To calibrate the market price of longevity risk, a common practice is to make use of market prices, such as longevity-linked se-curities and longevity indices. We use the BlackRock CoRI Retirement Indexes, which provides a daily level of estimated cost of lifetime retirement income for 20 cohorts in the U.S. Although investment in the index directly is not possible, individuals can invest in funds that track the index. For these 20 cohorts, we assume risk premiums for the common factors are the same across cohorts, but the risk premium of the factors for a specific cohort is allowed to take different values for different cohorts. The market prices of longevity risk are then calibrated by matching the risk-neutral model prices with BlackRock CoRI index values. Closed-form expressions and prices for European options on longevity zero-coupon bonds are derived using the model and compared to prices for standard options on zero coupon bonds. The impact of uncertain mortality on long term option prices is quantified and discussed.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper proposes a spatial-temporal autoregressive model for the mortality surface, where mortality rates of each age depend on the historical values of itself (temporality) and the neighbouring ages (spatiality). The mortality dynamics is formulated as a large, first order vector autoregressive model which encompasses standard factor models such as the Lee and Carter (1992) model. Sparsity and smoothness constraints are then introduced, based on the idea that the nearer the two ages, the more important the dependence between mortalities at these ages. Our model has several novelties. First, it ensures that in the long-run, mortality rates at different ages do not diverge. Second, it provides a natural explanation of the so-called cohort effect without identifiability difficulties. Third, the model is easily extended to the multiple-population case in a coherent way. Finally, the model is associated with a closed form, non-parametric estimation method: the penalized least square, which ensures spatial smoothness of the age-dependent parameters. Using US and UK mortality data, we find that our model produces reasonable projected mortality profile in the long-run, as well as satisfying short-run out-of-sample forecast performance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Credit risk has become a topical issue since the 2007 Credit Crisis, particularly for its impact on the valuation of OTC derivatives. This becomes critical when the credit risk of entities involved in a contract either as underlying or counterparty become highly correlated as is the case during macroeconomic shocks. It impacts the valuation of such contracts through an additional term, the credit valuation adjustment (CVA). This can become large with such correlation. This thesis outlines the main approaches to credit risk modelling, intensity and structural. It gives important examples of both and particular examples useful in the calculation of CVA, the intensity model of Brigo and the structural model of Hull and White. It details Brigo's market standard model independent framework for derivatives valuation with CVA. It does this for both its unilateral form where only one counterparty is credit risky and also for its bilateral form where both counterparties are credit risky. This thesis then shows how these frameworks can be applied to the valuation of a credit default swap contract (CDS). Finally, it shows how Brigo's and Hull and White's model for credit risk apply to the valuation of the CVA of CDS and draws comparisons, especially based on their ability to capture correlation effects.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To assess age, period, and birth cohort effects and patterns of obesity-attributable mortality in Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and the UK (UK). METHODS We obtained obesity prevalence and all-cause mortality data by age (20-79), sex and country for 1990-2012. We applied Clayton and Schifflers' age-period-cohort approach to obesity-attributable mortality rates (OAMRs). RESULTS Between 1990 and 2012, obesity prevalence increased and age-standardised OAMRs declined, although not uniformly. The nonlinear birth cohort effects contributed significantly (p {\textless} 0.01) to obesity-attributable mortality trends in all populations, except in Czech Republic, Finland, and among German women, and Polish men. Their contribution was greater than 25{\%} in UK and among French women, and larger than that of the nonlinear period effects. In the UK, mortality rate ratios (MRRs) increased among the cohorts born after 1950. In other populations with significant birth cohort effects, MRRs increased among the 1935-1960 cohorts and decreased thereafter. CONCLUSIONS Given its potential effects on obesity-attributable mortality, the cohort dimension should not be ignored and calls for interventions early in life next to actions targeting broader societal changes.},

Method: Using the Health Survey for England$\backslash$n2002-2006, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey (N=$\backslash$n54,422), multilevel logistic regression models with individuals nested$\backslash$nwithin primary sampling units were carried out, stratified by sex, on$\backslash$n(a) drinkers versus nondrinkers, (b) heavy episodic drinking versus$\backslash$ndrinking less (on the heaviest drinking day), and (c) fewer than 2$\backslash$ndrink-free days versus at least 2 drink-free days. Key exposures were$\backslash$nindividual social capital variables (social trust, active civic$\backslash$nparticipation, social support, neighborhood perception). Models adjusted$\backslash$nfor age, area-deprivation, economic activity, education, ethnicity,$\backslash$nlongstanding illness, marital status, and children in the household.$\backslash$nResults: Lack of social support (men: OR = 0.69, 95{\%} CI {\{}[{\}}0.60, 0.79];$\backslash$nwomen: OR = 0.77, 95{\%} CI {\{}[{\}}0.69, 0.86]) and no civic participation$\backslash$n(men: OR = 0.75, 95{\%} CI {\{}[{\}}0.67, 0.83]; women: OR = 0.73, 95{\%} CI$\backslash$n{\{}[{\}}0.68, 0.78]) decreased the odds of being a drinker versus a$\backslash$nnondrinker. Among men, low social trust increased (OR = 1.16, 95{\%} CI$\backslash$n{\{}[{\}}1.04, 1.30]) and no civic participation decreased (OR = 0.81, 95{\%} CI$\backslash$n{\{}[{\}}0.74, 0.89]) the odds of heavy episodic drinking; among women, good$\backslash$noverall neighborhood perception decreased the odds (OR = 0.91, 95{\%} CI$\backslash$n{\{}[{\}}0.86, 0.97]). Lack of social support (men: OR =1.25, 95{\%} CI {\{}[{\}}1.14,$\backslash$n1.36]; women: OR = 1.20, 95{\%} CI {\{}[{\}}1.02, 1.40]) and no civic$\backslash$nparticipation (men: OR = 1.25, 95{\%} CI {\{}[{\}}1.14, 1.36]; women: OR = 1.37,$\backslash$n95{\%} CI {\{}[{\}}1.25, 1.51]) increased the odds of having fewer than 2$\backslash$ndrink-free days. Men and women living in the most deprived areas were$\backslash$nless likely to drink, more likely to engage in heavy episodic drinking,$\backslash$nand more likely to have at least 2 alcohol-free days, after social$\backslash$ncapital variables were adjusted for. Conclusions: Social capital is$\backslash$nassociated with drinking alcohol, and low forms is associated with heavy$\backslash$nepisodic and frequent drinking. Interventions to reduce heavy episodic$\backslash$nconsumption should be targeted at those with low social capital and$\backslash$nthose living in deprived areas where heavy drinking is normalized.$\backslash$nDrink-free days recommended in guidelines could be further targeted at$\backslash$nthose lacking social support.},

The Affordable Care Act (ACA), passed in 2010 and fully implemented in 2014, was intended to expand coverage and bring about a new era of health-care access. In this review, we evaluate the legislation's impact on health-care equity. We consider the law's coverage expansion, insurance market reforms, cost and affordability provisions, and delivery-system reforms. Although the ACA improved coverage and access—particularly for poorer Americans, women, and minorities—its overall impact was modest in comparison with the gaps present before the law's implementation. Today, 29 million people in the USA remain uninsured, and substantial inequalities in access along economic, gender, and racial lines persist. Although most Americans agree that further reform is needed, the proper direction for reform—especially following the 2016 presidential election—is highly contentious. We discuss proposals for change from opposite sides of the political spectrum, together with their potential impact on health equity.},

abstract = {How DO, COULD, and SHOULD retirees draw down their financial savings? This paper reviews over one hundred papers on this topic from the perspective of individuals, families, governments and financial institutions. Three significant conceptual/methodological weaknesses in the existing literature are identified: (1) analysts have examined a limited range of self-managed drawdown strategies; (2) nearly all have ignored home ownership, pensions, debt, and government taxes and transfers when quantitatively evaluating alternative drawdown strategies and (3) there is a well-acknowledged gap between the behavior implied by economic models and that of real-life individuals, particularly when it comes to voluntary annuitization. Expanding the set of drawdown strategies evaluated (e.g. including larger payouts when life expectancy is reduced after the onset of a significant health condition, or using savings as bridge income to delay the take-up of Social Security payments), refining the income concept used, and more exact modeling of the trade-offs underlying individual decision-making will likely increase the appeal of self-managed drawdown strategies and help resolve the “annuity puzzle” that has long dominated this line of research. It may also lead to advice and financial products that will better meet the needs of retirees.},

The conclusion is that properly designed logistic modeling processes can more efficiently utilize available data to deliver solutions for multiple needs, including: a) testing mortality drivers' statistical significances in explaining mortality variations; b) estimating normalized mortality slopes and mortality differentials such as how mortality increases by duration or varies between underwriting classes while product and attained-age distributions are controlled; and c) addressing analytical challenges such as extrapolating for ultimate mor tality, smoothing between select and ultimate estimations, and constructing multidimensional basic experience tables.},

abstract = {Only five populations have achieved maximum life expectancy (or best practice population) more than occasionally since 1900. The aim of this article is to understand how maximum life expectancy is achieved in the context of mortality transition. We explore this aim using the concepts of potential life expectancy, based on minimum rates at each age among all high longevity populations, and concordant ages. Concordant ages are defined as ages at which the minimum death rate occurs in the population with the maximum life expectancy. The results show the extent to which maximum life expectancy could increase through the realization of demonstrably achievable minimum rates. Concordant ages are concentrated at increasingly older ages over time, but they have produced more than half of the change in maximum life expectancy in almost all periods since 1900. This finding is attributed to their quantity and position whereby concordant ages are concentrated at the ages that have the greatest impact on mortality decline in a particular period. Based on mortality forecasts, we expect that concordant ages will continue to lead increases in female maximum life expectancy, but that they will play a weaker role in male maximum life expectancy.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Although longevity risk arises from both the variation surrounding the trend in future mortality and the uncertainty about the trend itself, the latter is often left unmodeled. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing the locally linear CBD model, in which the drifts that govern the expected mortality trend are allowed to follow a stochastic process. This specification results in median forecasts that are more consistent with the recent trends and more robust relative to changes in the data sample period. It also yields wider prediction intervals that may better reflect the possibilities of future trend changes. The treatment of the drifts as a stochastic process naturally calls for nuga hedging, a method proposed by Cairns (2013) to hedge the risk associated with changes in drifts. To improve the existing nuga-hedging method, we propose a new hedging method which demands less stringent assumptions. The proposed method allows hedgers to extract more hedge effectiveness out of a hedging instrument, and is therefore useful when there are only a few traded longevity securities in the market.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We propose a data mining (DM) approach to predict the success of telemarketing calls for selling bank long-term deposits. A Portuguese retail bank was addressed, with data collected from 2008 to 2013, thus including the effects of the recent financial crisis. We analyzed a large set of 150 features related with bank client, product and social-economic attributes. A semi-automatic feature selection was explored in the modeling phase, performed with the data prior to July 2012 and that allowed to select a reduced set of 22 features. We also compared four DM models: logistic regression, decision trees (DTs), neural network (NN) and support vector machine. Using two metrics, area of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and area of the LIFT cumulative curve (ALIFT), the four models were tested on an evaluation set, using the most recent data (after July 2012) and a rolling window scheme. The NN presented the best results (AUC = 0.8 and ALIFT = 0.7), allowing to reach 79{\%} of the subscribers by selecting the half better classified clients. Also, two knowledge extraction methods, a sensitivity analysis and a DT, were applied to the NN model and revealed several key attributes (e.g.; Euribor rate, direction of the call and bank agent experience). Such knowledge extraction confirmed the obtained model as credible and valuable for telemarketing campaign managers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Heuer1997,
abstract = {For the analysis of time trends in incidence and mortality rates, the age-period-cohort (apc) model has became a widely accepted method. The considered data are arranged in a two-way table by age group and calendar period, which are mostly subdivided into 5- or 10-year intervals. The disadvantage of this approach is the loss of information by data aggregation and the problems of estimating interactions in the two-way layout without replications. In this article we show how splines can be useful when yearly data, i.e., 1-year age groups and 1-year periods, are given. The estimated spline curves are still smooth and represent yearly changes in the time trends. Further, it is straightforward to include interaction terms by the tensor product of the spline functions. If the data are given in a nonrectangular table, e.g., 5-year age groups and 1-year periods, the period and cohort variables can be parameterized by splines, while the age variable is parameterized as fixed effect levels, which leads to a semiparametric apc model. An important methodological issue in developing the nonparametric and semiparametric models is stability of the estimated spline curve at the boundaries. Here cubic regression splines will be used, which are constrained to be linear in the tails. Another point of importance is the nonidentifiability problem due to the linear dependency of the three time variables. This will be handled by decomposing the basis of each spline by orthogonal projection into constant, linear, and nonlinear terms, as suggested by Holford (1983, Biometrics 39, 311-324) for the traditional apc model. The advantage of using splines for yearly data compared to the traditional approach for aggregated data is the more accurate curve estimation for the nonlinear trend changes and the simple way of modeling interactions between the time variables. The method will be demonstrated with hypothetical data as well as with cancer mortality data.},

abstract = {The prevalence of obesity within countries varies by gender, age, lifestyle and socioeconomic factors. Identification of behavioural factors that are associated with obesity within the country's context is critical for the development of effective public health programs which aim to prevent and manage obesity. The objective of this study was to assess age and gender differentials in the prevalence of obesity in Lebanon and examine correlates of obesity with a focus on socioeconomic disparities. Following the WHO STEPwise guidelines, a national survey was conducted in Lebanon in 2008–2009. Households were selected randomly from all Governorates based on stratified cluster sampling method. One adult aged 20 years and over was randomly selected from each household for the interview. Anthropometric measurements and 24 hour recall dietary intake were obtained. The final sample included 1244 men and 1453 women. Descriptive statistics were computed for BMI, waist circumference, and percent body fat. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to assess the relationship between energy intake and obesity adjusted for relevant co-variables. The prevalence of obesity among Lebanese adults was 26.1{\%}. Gender differences in obesity estimates were observed across age groups and the three obesity classes, with men showing higher prevalence rates at the younger age groups (20–49 years), and women showing higher prevalence rates in older age groups (50 years and above). Obesity showed significant associations with socio-economic status in women; it decreased with higher educational attainment (OR = 0.54, 95{\%} CI: 0.32, 0.91), greater household assets (OR = 0.26; 95{\%} CI: 0.10, 0.72) and lower crowding index (OR = 0.62; 95{\%} CI: 0.39, 0.98), net of the effect of other co-variates. There was a significant positive association between obesity and energy intake in both genders, and a negative association between obesity and physical activity, significantly among women. Lifestyle and socioeconomic determinants of obesity are identified in this Lebanese population. Policy makers and service providers need to tailor public health strategies to tackle obesity accordingly.},

IMD 2004 is used extensively by local public health departments and researchers to describe and monitor socioeconomic inequalities in health. However, the inclusion of a health domain in IMD 2004 leads to the possibility of 'mathematical coupling' where a relationship between IMD 2004 and markers of health is predicated by the inclusion of health in IMD 2004-effectively placing measures of health on both sides of the correlation equation. We explored the effect of removing the health domain from IMD 2004 on assignment of small areas to deprivation groups and measured inequalities in health. There was excellent agreement between the deprivation quintiles that small areas were assigned to by IMD 2004 and IMD 2004-minus-health (kappa = 0.895). Removing the health domain had little, practical, effect on measured socioeconomic inequalities in census measures of health. These findings may not hold for other measures of health, and in the context of socioeconomic inequalities in health, removing the health domain from IMD 2004 probably represents best practice.},

Statisticians would have probably preferred more information about the underlying smoothing methods that were used. Epidemiologists likewise might miss discussions about the etiology of diseases. Sociologists would have probably expected that our results were more embedded into theoretical frameworks....

The model structure is an extension of the classical Lee-Carter method in which there is a common factor for the aggregate population, while a number of additional sex-specific factors can also be incorporated. The Poisson distribution is a natural choice for modelling the number of deaths, and its use provides a formal statistical framework for model selection, parameter estimation, and data analysis. Our results for Australian data show that this model leads to projected life expectancy values similar to those produced by the separate projection of mortality for females and males, but possesses the additional advantage of ensuring that the projected male-to-female ratio for death rates at each age converges to a constant. Moreover, the randomness of the corresponding residuals indicates that the model fit is satisfactory.},

abstract = {Previous research has revealed much global convergence over the past several decades in life expectancy at birth and in infant mortality, which are closely linked. But trends in the variance of length of life, and in the variance of length of adult life in particular, are less well understood. I examine life-span inequality in a comprehensive panel of 180 countries observed in 1970 and 2000. Convergence in infant mortality has unambiguously reduced world inequality in total length of life starting from birth, but world inequality in length of adult life has remained largely unchanged. Underlying both of these observations is a growing share of total inequality attributable to between-country variation. Especially among developed countries, the absolute level of between-country inequality has risen over time. The sources of widening inequality in length of life between countries remain unclear, but signs point away from changes in income, leaving patterns of knowledge diffusion as a likely candidate.},

abstract = {The second half of the twentieth century saw global demographic change of unprecedented magnitude, with pronounced falls in both mortality and fertility in many developing countries. This article assesses the extent to which these changes have led to the convergence of demographic patterns around the world. It considers not just the levels of fertility and mortality in each country at different points in time, but also the size of each population. It also disaggregates China and India into their constituent provinces and states in order to provide estimates for units more typical of the size of the populations of other countries. The note presents proportions of the world's population according to the levels of life expectancy and total fertility they experienced in the early 1950s, the late 1970s, and around 2000. The graphs and tables thus produced give a convenient and novel way to view the scale and nature of demographic convergence over the last 50 years.},

In this paper, we propose a stochastic framework to analyze a file-swarming system under realistic setting: constraints in upload/download capacity, collaboration among peers and incentive for chunk exchange. We first extend the results in the coupon system [L. Massoulie, M. Vojnovic, Coupon replication systems, in: Proc. ACM SIGMETRICS, Banff, Alberta, Canada, 2005] by providing a tighter performance bound. Then we generalize the coupon system by considering peers with limited upload and download capacity. We illustrate the last-piece problem and show the effectiveness of using forward error-correction (FEC) code and/or multiple requests to improve the performance. Lastly, we propose a framework to analyze an incentive-based file-swarming system. The stochastic framework we propose can serve as a basis for other researchers to analyze and design more advanced features of file-swarming systems. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to fit the model and to sample from the posterior predictive distribution. This paper also shows how multiple imputations can be readily incorporated into the model to handle missing data and presents some possible extensions to the model. The methodology is applied to U.S. male mortality data. Mortality rate forecasts are formed for the period 1990-1999 based on data from 1959-1989. These forecasts are compared to the actual observed values. Results from the forecasts show the Bayesian prediction intervals to be appropriately wider than those obtained from the Lee-Carter method, correctly incorporating all known sources of variability. An extension to the model is also presented and the resulting forecast variability appears better suited to the observed data.},

We analyse real data observed for annuity prices in the German market followed by the examination of the impact of unisex calculation, allowing for different assumed and realised gender compositions. To this end, we develop a realistically calibrated asset and liability model for a PLA with stochastic mortality, interest rates, and equity returns. We show that for males, the disadvantages of PLA's unisex pricing as compared to the gender-specific calculation are substantially lower, if we measure them by considering a lifetime utility that accounts for both distributed surpluses and stochastic mortality. For the insurance company, the gender mix composition turns out to be less important than the capital market influence. Moreover, participating life annuities turn out to be an efficient means to share actual mortality experience between insurance company and the annuitant, and can be, at least to a certain extent, considered a substitute for indemnity longevity hedge.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Gains in life expectancies have stalled in Scotland, as in several other countries, since around 2012. The relationship between stalling mortality improvements and socioeconomic inequalities in health is unclear. METHODS We calculate the difference, as percentage change, in all-cause, all-age, age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) between 2006 and 2011 (period 1) and between 2012 and 2017 (period 2), for Scotland overall, by sex, and by Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) quintile. Linear regression is used to summarise the relationship between SIMD quintile and mortality rate change in each period. RESULTS Between 2006 and 2011, the overall ASMR fell by 10.6{\%} (138/100 000), by 10.1{\%} in women, and 11.8{\%} in men, but between 2012 and 2017 the overall ASMR fell by only 2.6{\%} (30/100 000), by 3.5{\%} in women, and by 2.0{\%} in men. Within the most deprived quintile, the overall ASMR fell by 8.6{\%} (143/100 000) from 2006 to 2011 (7.2{\%} in women; 9.8{\%} in men), but rose by 1.5{\%} (21/100 000) from 2012 to 2017 (0.7{\%} in women; 2.1{\%} in men).The socioeconomic gradient in ASMR improvement more than quadrupled, from 0.4{\%} per quintile in period 1, to 1.7{\%} per quintile in period 2. CONCLUSION From 2012 to 2017, socioeconomic gradients in mortality improvement in Scotland were markedly steeper than over the preceding 6 years. As a result, there has not only been a slowdown in overall reductions in mortality, but a widening of socioeconomic mortality inequalities.},

abstract = {Two-population stochastic mortality models play a crucial role in the securitization of longevity risk. In particular, they allow us to quantify the population basis risk when longevity hedges are built from broad-based mortality indexes. In this paper, we propose and illustrate a systematic process for constructing a two-population mortality model for a pair of populations. The process encompasses four steps, namely (1) determining the conditions for biological reasonableness, (2) identifying an appropriate base model specification, (3) choosing a suitable time-series process and correlation structure for projecting period and/or cohort effects into the future, and (4) model evaluation. For each of the seven single-population models from Cairns et al. (2009), we propose two-population generalizations. We derive criteria required to avoid long-term divergence problems and the likelihood functions for estimating the models. We also explain how the parameter estimates are found, and how the models are systematically simplified to optimize the fit based on the Bayes Information Criterion. Throughout the paper, the results and methodology are illustrated using real data from two pairs of populations.},

abstract = {In developed countries, mortality decline is decelerating at younger ages and accelerating at old ages, a phenomenon we call "rotation." We expect that this rotation will also occur in developing countries as they attain high life expectancies. But the rotation is subtle and has proved difficult to handle in mortality models that include all age groups. Without taking it into account, however, long-term mortality projections will produce questionable results. We simplify the problem by focusing on the relative magnitude of death rates at two ages (0 and 15-19) while making assumptions about changes in rates of decline at other ages. We extend the Lee-Carter method to incorporate this subtle rotation in projection. We suggest that the extended Lee-Carter method could provide plausible projections of the age pattern of mortality for populations, including those that currently have very high life expectancies. Detailed examples are given using data from Japan and the United States.},

A MCS is a set of models that is constructed such that it will contain the best model with a given level of confidence. The MCS is in this sense analogous to a confidence interval for a parameter. The MCS acknowledges the limitations of the data, such that uninformative data yield a MCSwith many models, whereas informative data yield a MCS with only a few models. The MCS procedure does not assume that a particular model is the true model; in fact, the MCS procedure can be used to compare more general objects, beyond the comparison of models.We apply the MCS procedure to two empirical problems. First, we revisit the inflation forecasting problem posed by Stock and Watson (1999), and compute the MCS for their set of inflation forecasts. Second, we compare a number of Taylor rule regressions and determine the MCS of the best regression in terms of in-sample likelihood criteria.},

@article{Liu2017,
abstract = {The stochastic nature of future mortality arises from both period (time-related) and cohort (year-of-birth-related) effects. Existing index-based longevity hedging strategies mitigate the risk associated with period effects, but often overlook cohort effects. The negligence of cohort effects may lead to sub-optimal hedge effectiveness, if the liability being hedged is a deferred pension or annuity which involves cohorts that are not covered by the data sample. In this paper, we propose a new hedging strategy that incorporates both period and cohort effects. The resulting longevity hedge is a value hedge, reducing the uncertainty surrounding the $\tau$-year ahead value of the liability being hedged. The proposed method is illustrated with data from the male population of England and Wales. It is found that the benefit of incorporating cohort effects into a longevity hedging strategy depends heavily on the persistence of cohort effects and the choice of q-forwards.},

@article{Wilmoth1990,
abstract = {"The analysis of age-specific vital rates is studied, and special attention is given to the problem of decomposing an array of rates into factors related to age, period, and cohort.... The paper focuses on the age and period dimensions and derives an initial description of the matrix's structure with regard to changes only in those two directions. This two-dimensional description is then augmented by a consideration of residual patterns that seem clearly linked to cohorts. The use of a model that is asymmetric in age, period, and cohort is justified by a detailed discussion of the problems of identification in models involving perfectly collinear independent variables. An important conclusion is that traditional modeling approaches that treat age, period, and cohort in a symmetric fashion are fundamentally flawed." Some of these concepts are illustrated using mortality data from France. This is a revised version of a paper originally presented at the 1989 Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America (see Population Index, Vol. 55, No. 3, Fall 1989, pp. 375-6).},

This will be used to inform key decisions in future development and adaptation planning. The first phase, completed in June 2013, developed a consensus view of climate change trends and projections for South Africa. It summarised key climate change impacts and potential response options identified for primary sectors, namely water, agriculture and forestry, human health, marine fisheries, and biodiversity. The second phase will use an integrated assessment approach and model to develop adaptation scenarios for future climate conditions using the information, data and models from Phase 1 and inputs from a range of stakeholder consultations and task-team workshops. The Climate and Impacts Factsheet Series has been developed to communicate key messages emerging from LTAS Phase 1, and to complement the LTAS Phase 1 technical reports and the summary for policy-makers. This factsheet has been developed specifically to provide policy-and decision-makers, researchers, practitioners and civil society with up-to-date information on the climate change impacts, adaptation responses and future research needs for human health in South Africa. The information is built upon past and current research, including the Department of Health's National Climate Change and Health Adaptation Plan which is currently under development. The relationship between climate change impacts and health risks is not yet well-understood. In particular, research is not at a stage where the health impacts stemming from climate change can be accurately projected spatially and temporally. As a result, the LTAS Phase 1 adopted a narrative, theoretical approach to analysing the likely impacts of climate change on human health in South Africa. For further details see the LTAS Phase 1 full technical report entitled Climate Change Implications for Human Health in South Africa.},

abstract = {Widening economic inequality in the USA has been accompanied by increasing disparities in health outcomes. The life expectancy of the wealthiest Americans now exceeds that of the poorest by 10–15 years. This report, part of a Series on health and inequality in the USA, focuses on how the health-care system, which could reduce income-based disparities in health, instead often exacerbates them. Other articles in this Series address population health inequalities, and the health effects of racism, mass incarceration, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Poor Americans have worse access to care than do wealthy Americans, partly because many remain uninsured despite coverage expansions since 2010 due to the ACA. For individuals with private insurance, rising premiums and cost sharing have undermined wage gains and driven many households into debt and even bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the share of health-care resources devoted to care of the wealthy has risen. Additional reforms that move forward, rather than backward, from the ACA are sorely needed to mitigate health and health-care inequalities and reduce the financial burdens of medical care borne by non-wealthy Americans.},

@article{Sharrow2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a given population the age pattern of mortality is an important determinant of total number of deaths, age structure, and through effects on age structure, the number of births and thereby growth. Good mortality models exist for most populations except those experiencing generalized HIV epidemics and some developing country populations. The large number of deaths concentrated at very young and adult ages in HIV-affected populations produce a unique 'humped' age pattern of mortality that is not reproduced by any existing mortality models. Both burden of disease reporting and population projection methods require age-specific mortality rates to estimate numbers of deaths and produce plausible age structures. For countries with generalized HIV epidemics these estimates should take into account the future trajectory of HIV prevalence and its effects on age-specific mortality. In this paper we present a parsimonious model of age-specific mortality for countries with generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: The model represents a vector of age-specific mortality rates as the weighted sum of three independent age-varying components. We derive the age-varying components from a Singular Value Decomposition of the matrix of age-specific mortality rate schedules. The weights are modeled as a function of HIV prevalence and one of three possible sets of inputs: life expectancy at birth, a measure of child mortality, or child mortality with a measure of adult mortality. We calibrate the model with 320 five-year life tables for each sex from the World Population Prospects 2010 revision that come from the 40 countries of the world that have and are experiencing a generalized HIV epidemic. Cross validation shows that the model is able to outperform several existing model life table systems.

CONCLUSIONS: We present a flexible, parsimonious model of age-specific mortality for countries with generalized HIV epidemics. Combined with the outputs of existing epidemiological and demographic models, this model makes it possible to project future age-specific mortality profiles and number of deaths for countries with generalized HIV epidemics.},

abstract = {The evolution of senescence is often explained by arguing that, in nature, few individuals survive to be old and hence it is evolutionarily unimportant what happens to organisms when they are old. A corollary to this idea is that extrinsically imposed mortality, because it reduces the chance of surviving to be old, favors the evolution of senescence. We show that these ideas, although widespread, are incorrect. Selection leading to senescence does not depend directly on survival to old age, but on the shape of the stable age distribution, and we discuss the implications of this important distinction. We show that the selection gradient on mortality declines with age even in the hypothetical case of zero mortality, when survivorship does not decline. Changing the survivorship function by imposing age independent mortality has no affect on the selection gradients. A similar result exists for optimization models: age independent mortality does not change the optimal result. We propose an alternative, brief explanation for the decline of selection gradients, and hence the evolution of senescence.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2013, DAV / DGVFM. In this paper, a generalized GARCH-based stochastic mortality model is developed, which incorporates conditional heteroskedasticity and conditional non-normality. First, a detailed empirical analysis of the UK mortality rates from 1922 to 2009 is provided, where it was found that both the conditional heteroskedasticity and conditional non-normality are important empirical long-term structures of mortality. To describe conditional non-normality, a double-exponential distribution that allows conditional skewness and the heavy-tailed features found in the datasets was selected. For the practical implementation of the proposed model, a two-stage scheme was introduced to estimate the unknown parameters. First, the Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimation (QMLE) method was employed to estimate the GARCH structure. Next, the MLE was adopted to estimate the unknown parameters of the double-exponential distribution using residuals as input data. The model was then back-tested against the previous 10 years of mortality data to assess its forecasting ability, before Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to simulate and produce a table of forecast mortality rates from the optimal distribution.},

abstract = {This paper looks at the development of dynamic hedging strategies for typical pension plan liabilities using longevity-linked hedging instruments. Progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of closed-form formulae for the valuation of mortality-linked liabilities and assets, and the consequent requirement for simulations within simulations. We propose the use of the probit function along with a Taylor expansion to approximate longevity-contingent values. This makes it possible to develop and implement computationally efficient, discrete-time delta hedging strategies using q-forwards as hedging instruments. The methods are tested using the model proposed by Cairns et al. (2006a) (CBD). We find that the probit approximations are generally very accurate, and that the discrete-time hedging strategy is very effective at reducing risk. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Balbas2015,
abstract = {This paper deals with the optimal reinsurance problem if both insurer and reinsurer are facing risk and uncertainty, though the classical uncertainty free case is also included. The insurer and reinsurer degrees of uncertainty do not have to be identical. The decision variable is not the retained (or ceded) risk, but its sensitivity with respect to the total claims. Thus, if one imposes strictly positive lower bounds for this variable, the reinsurer moral hazard is totally eliminated.Three main contributions seem to be reached. Firstly, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are given in a very general setting. Secondly, the optimal contract is often a bang-bang solution, i.e., the sensitivity between the retained risk and the total claims saturates the imposed constraints. Thirdly, the optimal reinsurance problem is equivalent to other linear programming problem, despite the fact that risk, uncertainty, and many premium principles are not linear. This may be important because linear problems may be easily solved in practice, since there are very efficient algorithms.},

abstract = {The determination of the value of a derivative must be considered in conjunction with credit risk and collateral agreements. Credit risk is now a significant issue for derivatives dealers when they trade in the non-centrally-cleared over-the-counter market. Also, the interest rate paid on cash collateral can influence pricing and this is likely to become a more important consideration because recent regulatory proposals are expected to lead to an increase in collateral requirements.2 The usual approach to dealing with counterparty credit risk is to first calculate a “no-default value.” This value is then reduced by the expected loss due to the possibility of a default by the counterparty and increased by the expected gain due to the possibility of a default by the dealer. The expected loss due to a possible default by the counterparty is referred to as the credit value adjustment (CVA) and the expected gain due to a possible default by the dealer is referred to as the debit (or debt) value adjustment (DVA).3 A further adjustment for the interest paid on cash collateral may be necessary. We will refer to this as the collateral rate adjustment (CRA).},

Unfortunately, one can not uniquely estimate the effects that generated the outcome data because these effects are linearly dependent. It is possible, however, to estimate certain linear combinations of these effects that are themselves unique estimates of the data generating parameters. The author demonstrates that all of the least square solutions for the APC model lie on a line in multidimensional solution space. This characteristic of the solutions to the APC model allows for a unified approach to the derivation of estimable functions, which is then used to derive the most prominent estimable functions in the APC literature and can be used to discover new ones. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

In contrast to previous studies, the model relies on the probability distribution of a default time rather than the default time itself, as the default time is usually inaccessible. As such, the model can achieve a high order of accuracy and is relatively easy to implement. The model captures wrong-way or right-way risk naturally. Using a unique dataset, the author finds empirical evidence that wrong- or right-way risk has a material effect on risky valuation and CVA. The magnitude of the impact is greater in credit and equity markets. The results also indicate that diversification is an effective way to mitigate wrong- or right-way risk.},

Here, a stochastic projection model is proposed in order to represent the future evolution of mortality and disability transition intensities. Data from the Italian National Institute of Social Security (INPS) and from Human Mortality Database (HMD) are used to estimate the model parameters. Secondly, it investigates the solvency in a portfolio of enhanced pensions. To this aim a risk model based on the portfolio risk reserve is proposed and different rules to calculate solvency capital requirements for life underwriting risk are examined.

We estimate a mixed proportional hazards model with treatment effects, which disentangles the broken-heart syndrome from the spurious risk dependence induced by unobserved heterogeneities. We use a flexible semi-parametric distribution for the unobserved heterogeneities to allow for either positive or negative spurious risk dependence. We find that the effect of losing one's spouse is asymmetric for the two sexes. Moreover, although the broken-heart syndrome explains a large portion of the dependency, there is evidence of positive spurious risk dependence. These findings have important implications for the pricing of joint insurance products. Failure to take into account either of these two effects leads to pricing error that can be either positive or negative, depending on the characteristics of the couple.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Saurel-Cubizolles2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare inequalities in mortality (all causes and by cause) by occupational group and educational level between men and women living in France in the 1990s. METHODS: Data were analysed from a permanent demographic sample currently including about one million people. The French Institute of Statistics (INSEE) follows the subjects and collects demographic, social and occupational information from the census schedules and vital status forms. Causes of death were obtained from the national file of the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM). A relative index of inequality (RII) was calculated to quantify inequalities as a function of educational level and occupational group. Overall all-cause mortality, mortality due to cancer, mortality due to cardiovascular disease and mortality due to external causes (accident, suicide, violence) were considered. RESULTS: Overall, social inequalities were found to be wider among men than among women, for all-cause mortality, cancer mortality and external-cause mortality. However, this trend was not observed for cardiovascular mortality, for which the social inequalities were greater for women than for men, particularly for mortality due to ischaemic cardiac diseases. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for persistent social inequalities in mortality in France, in both men and women. These findings highlight the need for greater attention to social determinants of health. The reduction of cardiovascular disease mortality in low educational level groups should be treated as a major public health priority.},

abstract = {The remarkable growth in life expectancy during the twentieth century inspired predictions of a future in which all people, not just a fortunate few, will live long lives ending at or near the maximum human life span. We show that increased longevity has been accompanied by less variation in ages at death, but survivors to the oldest ages have grown increasingly heterogeneous in their mortality risks. These trends are consistent across countries, and apply even to populations with record-low variability in the length of life. We argue that as a result of continuing improvements in survival, delayed mortality selection has shifted health disparities from early to later life, where they manifest in the growing inequalities in late-life mortality. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Population Council, Inc.},

abstract = {The usefulness of a predictor evaluation framework which combines a blocked cross-validation scheme with directional accuracy measures is investigated. The advantage of using a blocked cross-validation scheme with respect to the standard out-of-sample procedure is that cross-validation yields more precise error estimates of the prediction error since it makes full use of the data. In order to quantify the gain in precision when directional accuracy measures are considered, a Monte Carlo analysis using univariate and multivariate models is provided. The experiments indicate that more precise estimates are obtained with the blocked cross-validation procedure. An application is carried out on forecasting UK interest rate for illustration purposes. The results show that in such a situation with small samples the cross-validation scheme may have considerable advantages over the standard out-of-sample evaluation procedure as it may help to overcome problems induced by the limited information the directional accuracy measures contain due to their binary nature. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Theory predicts that senescence should inevitably evolve because selection pressure declines with age. Yet, data show that senescence is not a universal phenomenon. How can these observations peacefully coexist? Evolution of any trait hinges on its impact on fitness. A complete mathematical description of change in fitness, the total fitness differential, involves selection pressure along with a perturbation function that describes how the vital rates, mortality and fecundity, are affected across ages. We propose that the perturbation function can be used to model trade-offs when vital rates are perturbed in different directions and magnitude at different ages. We find that for every trade-off we can identify parameter values for which senescence does evolve and others for which it does not. We argue that this reconciles the apparent contradiction between data and theory. The total fitness differential is also instrumental in deriving mathematical relationships between alternative indicators of selection pressure. We show examples and highlight that any indicator combined with the right perturbation function can be used to parameterize a specific biological change. Biological considerations should motivate what perturbation functions are used. We interpret the relevance of Hamilton's finding that selection pressure declines for the evolution of senescence: declining selection pressure is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, The Author(s). The educational gradient in life expectancy is well documented in the United States and in other low-mortality countries. Highly educated Americans, on average, live longer than their low-educated counterparts, who have recently seen declines in adult life expectancy. However, limiting the discussion on lifespan inequality to mean differences alone overlooks other dimensions of inequality and particularly disparities in lifespan variation. The latter represents a unique form of inequality, with higher variation translating into greater uncertainty in the time of death from an individual standpoint, and higher group heterogeneity from a population perspective. Using data from the National Vital Statistics System from 1990 to 2010, this is the first study to document trends in both life expectancy and S 25 —the standard deviation of age at death above 25—by educational attainment. Among low-educated whites, adult life expectancy declined by 3.1 years for women and by 0.6 years for men. At the same time, S 25 increased by about 1.5 years among high school–educated whites of both genders, becoming an increasingly important component of total lifespan inequality. By contrast, college-educated whites benefited from rising life expectancy and record low variation in age at death, consistent with the shifting mortality scenario. Among blacks, adult life expectancy increased, and S 25 plateaued or declined in nearly all educational attainment groups, although blacks generally lagged behind whites of the same gender on both measures. Documenting trends in lifespan variation can therefore improve our understanding of lifespan inequality and point to diverging trajectories in adult mortality across socioeconomic strata.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examined the extent to which area- and individual-level socioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular-disease (CVD), heart disease, and stroke mortality among United States men and women aged 25-64 years changed between 1969 and 2011. METHODS: National vital statistics data and the National Longitudinal Mortality Study were used to estimate area- and individual-level socioeconomic gradients in mortality over time. Rate ratios and log-linear and Cox regression were used to model mortality trends and differentials. RESULTS: Area socioeconomic gradients in mortality from CVD, heart disease, and stroke increased substantially during the study period. Compared to those in the most affluent group, individuals in the most deprived area group had, respectively 35{\%}, 29{\%}, and 73{\%} higher CVD, heart disease, and stroke mortality in 1969, but 120-121{\%} higher mortality in 2007-2011. Gradients were steeper for women than for men. Education, income, and occupation were inversely associated with CVD, heart disease, and stroke mortality, with individual-level socioeconomic gradients being steeper during 1990-2002 than in 1979-1989. Individuals with low education and incomes had 2.7 to 3.7 times higher CVD, heart disease, and stroke mortality risks than their counterparts with high education and income levels. CONCLUSIONS AND GLOBAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS: Although mortality declined for all US groups during 1969-2011, socioeconomic disparities in mortality from CVD, heart disease and stroke remained marked and increased over time because of faster declines in mortality among higher socioeconomic groups. Widening disparities in mortality may reflect increasing temporal areal inequalities in living conditions, behavioral risk factors such as smoking, obesity and physical inactivity, and access to and use of health services. With social inequalities and prevalence of smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity on the rise, most segments of the working-age population in low- and middle-income countries will likely experience increased cardiovascular-disease burden in terms of higher morbidity and mortality rates.},

abstract = {Many real-world optimization problems have several, usually conflicting objectives. Evolutionary multi-objective optimization usually solves this predicament by searching for the whole Pareto-optimal front of solutions, and relies on a decision maker to finally select a single solution. However, in particular if the number of objectives is large, the number of Pareto-optimal solutions may be huge, and it may be very difficult to pick one best solution out of this large set of alternatives. As we argue in this paper, the most interesting solutions of the Pareto-optimal front are solutions where a small improvement in one objective would lead to a large deterioration in at least one other objective. These solutions are sometimes also called knees . We then introduce a new modified multi-objective evolutionary algorithm which is able to focus search on these knee regions, resulting in a smaller set of solutions which are likely to be more relevant to the decision maker.},

We show that lung cancer and overall mortality can be satisfactorily modelled using cohort relative risk and a fixed age pattern. The results of the model suggest that smoking by itself can account for a substantial fraction of change in cohort mortality for those born around the first half of the twentieth century. In particular, smoking provides an explanation for the higher-than-average improvement in the mortality of both males and females born around 1930. Our confidence in the correctness of the results of the models is strengthened by the fact that they are very similar to those of the Peto-Lopez and Preston-Glei-Wilmoth models that estimate the contribution of smoking-related to overall mortality.},

Proton magnetic spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) techniques can be used to study lactate in vivo; however, accurate measurement of cerebral lactate, which is normally at low basal abundance, can be challenging. In this study, regional lactate measurements obtained with two different MRSI analytic approaches were evaluated using proton echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (PEPSI) data from 18 healthy adults participating in an in vivo sodium lactate infusion study. The results demonstrate that averaging data within a region of interest (ROI) before spectral fitting with LCModel results in significantly improved lactate measurement as compared to averaging chemical concentrations derived from the fitting of individual voxels in the ROI. Simulation results that confirm this finding are also presented. This study additionally outlines an atlas-based approach for the systematic computation of regional distributions of chemical concentrations in large MRSI data sets.},

The use of the method with Australian data is compromised by significant departures from linearity in the time component and changes over time in the age component. We modify the method to adjust the time component to reproduce the age distribution of deaths, rather than total deaths, and to determine the optimal fitting period in order to address non-linearity in the time component. In the Australian case the modification has the added advantage that the assumption of invariance is better met. For Australian data, the modifications result in higher forecast life expectancy than the original Lee-Carter method and official projections, and a 50 per cent reduction in forecast error. The model is also expanded to take account of age-time interactions by incorporating additional terms, but these are not readily incorporated into forecasts.},

abstract = {Life expectancy at birth has roughly tripled over the course of human history. Early gains were due to a general improvement in living standards and organized efforts to control the spread of infectious disease. Reductions in infant and child mortality in the late 19th and early 20th century led to a rapid increase in life expectancy at birth. Since 1970, the main factor driving continued gains in life expectancy in industrialized countries is a reduction in death rates among the elderly. In particular, death rates due to cardiovascular disease and cancer have declined in recent decades thanks to a variety of factors, including successful medical intervention. Based on available demographic evidence, the human life span shows no sign of approaching a fixed limit imposed by biology or other factors. Rather, both the average and the maximum human life span have increased steadily over time for more than a century. The complexity and historical stability of these changes suggest that the most reliable method of predicting the future is merely to extrapolate past trends. Such methods suggest that life expectancy at birth in industrialized countries will be about 85-87years at the middle of the 21st century.},

Based on the three key features-location, sex-specific difference , and level-I analyze past and present trends in the lower boundary of human mortality. The analysis is based on cohort mortality data for 38 countries, covering all the cohorts born between 1900 and 1993. Minimum mortality is analyzed using observed as well as smoothed estimates. The results show that the ages at which minimum mortality is reached have shifted to lower ages. Although the differences have become almost negligible over time, males are showing higher levels of minimum mortality than females. The level of minimum mortality was halved more than five times over the analyzed time horizon. The results also suggest that even after more than 150 years of mortality improvements, minimum mortality has not yet reached a lowest limit and is likely to decrease further in the near future. Trends in the three key features also raise questions about the importance of evolutionary, social, and biological determinants for the recent and future development of minimum mortality.},

We derive each of these indices from an absorbing Markov chain formulation of the life table, and use matrix calculus to obtain the sensitivity and the elasticity (i.e., the proportional sensitivity) to changes in age-specific mortality. Using empirical French and Russian male data, we compare the underlying sensitivities to mortality change under different mortality regimes to determine the conditions under which the indices might differ in their conclusions about the magnitude of lifespan variation. Finally, we demonstrate how the sensitivities can be used to decompose temporal changes in the indices into contributions of age-specific mortality changes. The result is an easily computable method for calculating the properties of this important class of longevity indices. {\textcopyright} 2013 Population Association of America.},

abstract = {Background Social inequality trends in life expectancy are not informative as to changes in social disparity in the age-at-death distribution. The purpose of the study was to investigate social differentials in trends and patterns of adult mortality in Denmark. Methods Register data on income and mortality from 1986 to 2014 were used to investigate trends in life expectancy, life disparity and the threshold age that separates {\^{a}} € premature' and late' deaths. Mortality compression was quantified and compared between income quartiles. Results Since 1986, male life expectancy increased by 4.2 years for the lowest income quartile and by 8.4 years for the highest income quartile. The clear compression of mortality apparent in the highest income quartile did not occur for the lowest income quartile. Premature and late deaths accounted both by 2.1 years of the increase in life expectancy in the lowest income quartile and by 6.0 and 2.4 years, respectively, in the highest income quartile. Life expectancy increased by 5.2 years among women in the lowest income quartile, 2.4 years due to premature deaths and 2.8 years due to late deaths. The gain in life expectancy among women in the highest income quartile of 5.6 years was distributed by 5.0 and 0.6 years due to premature and late deaths, respectively. Conclusion The study demonstrates that the increasing social gap in mortality appears differently in the change of the age-at-death distribution. Thus, no compression of mortality was seen in the lowest income quartile. The results do not provide support for a uniformly extension of pension age for all.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Understanding the major health problems in the United States and how they are changing over time is critical for informing national health policy.$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To measure the burden of diseases, injuries, and leading risk factors in the United States from 1990 to 2010 and to compare these measurements with those of the 34 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.$\backslash$nDESIGN: We used the systematic analysis of descriptive epidemiology of 291 diseases and injuries, 1160 sequelae of these diseases and injuries, and 67 risk factors or clusters of risk factors from 1990 to 2010 for 187 countries developed for the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study to describe the health status of the United States and to compare US health outcomes with those of 34 OECD countries. Years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) were computed by multiplying the number of deaths at each age by a reference life expectancy at that age. Years lived with disability (YLDs) were calculated by multiplying prevalence (based on systematic reviews) by the disability weight (based on population-based surveys) for each sequela; disability in this study refers to any short- or long-term loss of health. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. Deaths and DALYs related to risk factors were based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses of exposure data and relative risks for risk-outcome pairs. Healthy life expectancy (HALE) was used to summarize overall population health, accounting for both length of life and levels of ill health experienced at different ages.$\backslash$nRESULTS: US life expectancy for both sexes combined increased from 75.2 years in 1990 to 78.2 years in 2010; during the same period, HALE increased from 65.8 years to 68.1 years. The diseases and injuries with the largest number of YLLs in 2010 were ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and road injury. Age-standardized YLL rates increased for Alzheimer disease, drug use disorders, chronic kidney disease, kidney cancer, and falls. The diseases with the largest number of YLDs in 2010 were low back pain, major depressive disorder, other musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety disorders. As the US population has aged, YLDs have comprised a larger share of DALYs than have YLLs. The leading risk factors related to DALYs were dietary risks, tobacco smoking, high body mass index, high blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Among 34 OECD countries between 1990 and 2010, the US rank for the age-standardized death rate changed from 18th to 27th, for the age-standardized YLL rate from 23rd to 28th, for the age-standardized YLD rate from 5th to 6th, for life expectancy at birth from 20th to 27th, and for HALE from 14th to 26th.$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: From 1990 to 2010, the United States made substantial progress in improving health. Life expectancy at birth and HALE increased, all-cause death rates at all ages decreased, and age-specific rates of years lived with disability remained stable. However, morbidity and chronic disability now account for nearly half of the US health burden, and improvements in population health in the United States have not kept pace with advances in population health in other wealthy nations.},

We demonstrate a robust and scalable SPCA algorithm by formulating it as a value-function optimization problem. This viewpoint leads to a flexible and computationally efficient algorithm. It can further leverage randomized methods from linear algebra to extend the approach to the large-scale (big data) setting. Our proposed innovation also allows for a robust SPCA formulation which can obtain meaningful sparse components in spite of grossly corrupted input data. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated using both synthetic and real world data, showing exceptional computational efficiency and diagnostic performance.},

@article{Dong2016a,
abstract = {Driven by technological progress, human life expectancy has increased greatly since the nineteenth century. Demographic evidence has revealed an ongoing reduction in old-age mortality and a rise of the maximum age at death, which may gradually extend human longevity. Together with observations that lifespan in various animal species is flexible and can be increased by genetic or pharmaceutical intervention, these results have led to suggestions that longevity may not be subject to strict, species-specific genetic constraints. Here, by analysing global demographic data, we show that improvements in survival with age tend to decline after age 100, and that the age at death of the world's oldest person has not increased since the 1990s. Our results strongly suggest that the maximum lifespan of humans is fixed and subject to natural constraints.},

abstract = {In this article, a multivariate structural time series model with common stochastic trends is proposed to forecast longevity gains of a population with a short time series of observed mortality rates, using the information of a related population for which longer mortality time series exist. The state space model proposed here makes use of the seemingly unrelated time series equation and applies the concepts of related series and common trends to construct a proper model to predict the future mortality rates of a population with little available information. This common trends approach works by assuming the two populations' mortality rates are affected by common factors. Further, we show how this model can be used by insurers and pension funds to forecast mortality rates of policyholders and beneficiaries. We apply the proposed model to Brazilian annuity plans where life expectancies and their temporal evolution are predicted using the forecast longevity gains. Finally, to demonstrate how the model can be used in actuarial practice, the best estimate of the liabilities and the capital based on underwriting risk are estimated by means of Monte Carlo simulation. The idiosyncratic risk effect in the process of calculating an amount of underwriting capital is also illustrated using that simulation.},

abstract = {Female and male life expectancies have converged in most industrialized societies in recent decades. To achieve coherent forecasts between females and males, this convergence needs to be considered when forecasting sex-specific mortality. We introduce a model forecasting a matrix of the age-specific death rates of sex ratio, decomposed into two age profiles and time indices—before and after age 45—using principal component analysis. Our model allows visualization of both age structure and general level over time of sex differences in mortality for these two age groups. Based on a prior forecast for females, we successfully forecast male mortality convergence with female mortality. The usefulness of the developed model is illustrated by its comparison with other coherent and independent models in an out-of-sample forecast evaluation for 18 countries. The results show that the new proposal outperformed the other models for most countries.},

abstract = {Women in almost all modern populations live longer than men. Research to date provides evidence for both biological and social factors influencing this gender gap. Conditions when both men and women experience extremely high levels of mortality risk are unexplored sources of information. We investigate the survival of both sexes in seven populations under extreme conditions from famines, epidemics, and slavery. Women survived better than men: In all populations, they had lower mortality across almost all ages, and, with the exception of one slave population, they lived longer on average than men. Gender differences in infant mortality contributed the most to the gender gap in life expectancy, indicating that newborn girls were able to survive extreme mortality hazards better than newborn boys. Our results confirm the ubiquity of a female survival advantage even when mortality is extraordinarily high. The hypothesis that the survival advantage of women has fundamental biological underpinnings is supported by the fact that under very harsh conditions females survive better than males even at infant ages when behavioral and social differences may be minimal or favor males. Our findings also indicate that the female advantage differs across environments and is modulated by social factors.},

This study investigates the conditional heteroskedasticity of mortality in terms of statistical time series. We start from testing the conditional heteroskedasticity of the period effect in the na{\"{i}}ve Lee-Carter model for some mortality data. Then we introduce the Generalized Dynamic Factor method and the multivariate BEKK GARCH model to describe mortality dynamics and the conditional heteroskedasticity of mortality. After specifying the number of static factors and dynamic factors by several variants of information criterion, we compare our model with other two models, namely, the Lee-Carter model and the state space model. Based on several error-based measures of performance, our results indicate that if the number of static factors and dynamic factors is properly determined, the method proposed dominates other methods. Finally, we use our method combined with Kalman filter to forecast the mortality rates of Iceland and period life expectancies of Denmark, Finland, Italy and Netherlands. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Gan2015,
abstract = {A variable annuity (VA) is equity-linked annuity product that has rapidly grown in popularity around the world in recent years. Research up to date on VA largely focuses on the valuation of guarantees embedded in a single VA contract. However, methods developed for individual VA contracts based on option pricing theory cannot be extended to large VA portfolios. Insurance companies currently use nested simulation to valuate guarantees for VA portfolios but efficient valuation under nested simulation for a large VA portfolio has been a real challenge. The computation in nested simulation is highly intensive and often prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines a clustering technique with a functional data analysis technique to address the issue. We create a highly non-homogeneous synthetic VA portfolio of 100,000 contracts and use it to estimate the dollar Delta of the portfolio at each time step of outer loop scenarios under the nested simulation framework over a period of 25 years. Our test results show that the proposed approach performs well in terms of accuracy and efficiency.},

@article{Norheim2015,
abstract = {Background The UN will formulate ambitious Sustainable Development Goals for 2030, including one for health. Feasible goals with some quantifiable, measurable targets can influence governments. We propose, as a quatitative health target, "Avoid in each country 40{\%} of premature deaths (under-70 deaths that would be seen in the 2030 population at 2010 death rates), and improve health care at all ages". Targeting overall mortality and improved health care ignores no modifiable cause of death, nor any cause of disability that is treatable (or also causes many deaths). 40{\%} fewer premature deaths would be important in all countries, but implies very different priorities in different populations. Reinforcing this target for overall mortality in each country are four global subtargets for 2030: avoid two-thirds of child and maternal deaths; two-thirds of tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria deaths; a third of premature deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs); and a third of those from other causes (other communicable diseases, undernutrition, and injuries). These challenging subtargets would halve under-50 deaths, avoid a third of the (mainly NCD) deaths at ages 50-69 years, and so avoid 40{\%} of under-70 deaths. To help assess feasibility, we review mortality rates and trends in the 25 most populous countries, in four country income groupings, and worldwide. Methods UN sources yielded overall 1970-2010 mortality trends. WHO sources yielded cause-specific 2000-10 trends, standardised to country-specific 2030 populations; decreases per decade of 42{\%} or 18{\%} would yield 20-year reductions of two-thirds or a third. Results Throughout the world, except in countries where the effects of HIV or political disturbances predominated, mortality decreased substantially from 1970-2010, particularly in childhood. From 2000-10, under-70 age-standardised mortality rates decreased 19{\%} (with the low-income and lower-middle-income countries having the greatest absolute gains). The proportional decreases per decade (2000-10) were: 34{\%} at ages 0-4 years; 17{\%} at ages 5-49 years; 15{\%} at ages 50-69 years; 30{\%} for communicable, perinatal, maternal, or nutritional causes; 14{\%} for NCDs; and 13{\%} for injuries (accident, suicide, or homicide). Interpretation Moderate acceleration of the 2000-10 proportional decreases in mortality could be feasible, achieving the targeted 2030 disease-specific reductions of two-thirds or a third. If achieved, these reductions avoid about 10 million of the 20 million deaths at ages 0-49 years that would be seen in 2030 at 2010 death rates, and about 17 million of the 41 million such deaths at ages 0-69 years. Such changes could be achievable by 2030, or soon afterwards, at least in areas free of war, other major effects of political disruption, or a major new epidemic.},

Regularization is a statistical approach for avoiding over-parameterization, and it can reduce estimation and predictive variances compared to MLE. In Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation, regularization is accomplished by the use of mean-zero priors, and the degree of parsimony can be optimized by numerically efficient out-of-sample cross-validation. This provides a consistent framework for comparing a variety of regularized MCMC models, such as those built with cubic splines, linear splines (as ours is), and the limiting case of non-regularized estimation. We apply this to the multiple-trend model of Hunt and Blake (2014).},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Redistribution methods for garbage codes (implausible or insufficiently specific cause of death codes) and small area estimation methods (statistical methods for estimating rates in small subpopulations) were applied to death registration data from the National Vital Statistics System to estimate annual county-level mortality rates for 21 causes of death. These estimates were raked (scaled along multiple dimensions) to ensure consistency between causes and with existing national-level estimates. Geographic patterns in the age-standardized mortality rates in 2014 and in the change in the age-standardized mortality rates between 1980 and 2014 for the 10 highest-burden causes were determined.

abstract = {Since the last financial crisis, a relevant effort in quantitative finance research concerns the consideration of counterparty risk in financial contracts, specially in the pricing of derivatives. As a consequence of this new ingredient, new models, mathematical tools and numerical methods are required. In the present paper, we mainly consider the problem formulation in terms of partial differential equations (PDEs) models to price the total credit value adjustment (XVA) to be added to the price of the derivative without counterparty risk. Thus, in the case of European options and forward contracts different linear and nonlinear PDEs arise. In the present paper we propose suitable boundary conditions and original numerical methods to solve these PDEs problems. Moreover, for the first time in the literature, we consider XVA associated to American options by the introduction of complementarity problems associated to PDEs, as well as numerical methods to be added in order to solve them. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the behavior of the models and numerical method to recover the expected qualitative and quantitative properties of the XVA adjustments in different cases. Also, the first order convergence of the numerical method is illustrated when applied to particular cases in which the analytical expression for the XVA is available.},

abstract = {Credit (CVA), Debit (DVA) and Funding Valuation Adjustments (FVA) are now familiar valuation adjustments made to the value of a portfolio of derivatives to account for credit risks and funding costs. However, recent changes in the regulatory regime and the increases in regulatory capital requirements has led many banks to include the cost of capital in derivative pricing. This paper formalises the addition of cost of capital by extending the Burgard-Kjaer (2013) semi-replication approach to CVA and FVA to include an addition capital term, Capital Valuation Adjustment (KVA, i.e. Kapital Valuation Adjustment to distinguish from CVA.) The utilization of the capital for funding purposes is also considered. The use of the semi-replication approach means that the flexibility around the treatment of self-default is carried over into this analysis. The paper further considers the practical calculation of KVA with reference to the Basel II (BCBS-128) and Basel III (BCBS-189) capital regimes and their implementation via CRD IV. The paper also assesses how KVA may be hedged, given that any hedging transactions themselves lead to regulatory capital requirements and hence capital costs. Finally a number of numerical examples are presented to gauge the cost impact of KVA on vanilla derivative products.},

Time-trend data in the United States indicate a narrowing of the gap between the best- and worst-off groups in some health indicators, such as life expectancy, but a widening of the gap in others, such as diabetes prevalence. Similarly, time-trend data in the United Kingdom indicate a narrowing of the gap between the best- and worst-off groups in some indicators, such as hypertension prevalence, whereas the gap between social classes has increased for life expectancy.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES As wearable sensors take the consumer market by storm, and medical device manufacturers move to make their devices wireless and appropriate for ambulatory use, this revolution brings with it some unintended consequences, which we aim to discuss in this paper. METHODS We discuss some important unintended consequences, both beneficial and unwanted, which relate to: modifications of behavior; creation and use of big data sets; new security vulnerabilities; and unforeseen challenges faced by regulatory authorities, struggling to keep pace with recent innovations. Where possible, we proposed potential solutions to unwanted consequences. RESULTS Intelligent and inclusive design processes may mitigate unintended modifications in behavior. For big data, legislating access to and use of these data will be a legal and political challenge in the years ahead, as we trade the health benefits of wearable sensors against the risk to our privacy. The wireless and personal nature of wearable sensors also exposes them to a number of unique security vulnerabilities. Regulation plays an important role in managing these security risks, but also has the dual responsibility of ensuring that wearable devices are fit for purpose. However, the burden of validating the function and security of medical devices is becoming infeasible for regulators, given the many software apps and wearable sensors entering the market each year, which are only a subset of an even larger 'internet of things'. CONCLUSION Wearable sensors may serve to improve wellbeing, but we must be vigilant against the occurrence of unintended consequences. With collaboration between device manufacturers, regulators, and end-users, we balance the risk of unintended consequences occurring against the incredible benefit that wearable sensors promise to bring to the world.},

It provides a detailed analysis of two such securities the Swiss Re mortality bond issued in December 2003 and the EIB/BNP longevity bond announced in November 2004. It then looks at the universe of hypothetical mortality-linked securities other forms of longevity bonds, swaps, futures and options and investigates their potential uses. It also addresses implementation issues, and draws lessons from the experiences of other derivative contracts. Particular attention is paid to the issues involved with the construction and use of mortality indices, the management of the associated credit risks, and possible barriers to the development of markets for these securities. It suggests that these implementation difficulties are essentially teething problems that will be resolved over time, and so leave the way open to the development of flourishing markets in a brand new class of securities.},

A pretest posttest quasi-experimental mixed methods design was utilized to determine any differences in student achievement that might be associated with the instructional approach being used. In addition, the scalability of each approach was evaluated along with students' perceptions of these approaches to determine the affect each intervention might have on a student's motivation to learn. The simulation-based instruction tested in this study was found to be an extremely scalable solution but less effective than the regular classroom and flipped classroom approaches in terms of student learning. While students did demonstrate learning gains, the process focus of the simulation's instruction and assessments frustrated students and decreased their motivation to learn. Students' attitudes towards the topic, their willingness to refer the course to others, and the likelihood that they would take another course like this were considerably lower than those of students in the flipped or regular classroom situations. The results of this study support the conclusion that a technology enhanced flipped classroom was both effective and scalable; it better facilitated learning than the simulation-based training and students found this approach to be more motivating in that it allowed for greater differentiation of instruction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Factors including smoking, drinking, substance abuse, obesity, and health care have all been shown to affect health and longevity. The relative importance of each of these factors is disputed in the literature, and has been assessed through a number of methods. OBJECTIVE: This paper uses a novel approach to identify factors responsible for interstate mortality variation. It identifies factors through their imprint on mortality patterns and can therefore identify factors that are difficult or impossible to measure directly, such as sensitive health behaviors. METHODS: The analysis calculates age-standardized death rates by cause of death from 2000-2009 for white men and women separately. Only premature deaths between ages 20-64 are included. Latent variables responsible for mortality variation are then identified through a factor analysis conducted on a death-rate-by-state matrix. These unobserved latent variables are inferred from observed mortality data and interpreted based on their correlations with individual causes of death. RESULTS: Smoking and obesity, substance abuse, and rural/urban residence are the three factors that make the largest contributions to state-level mortality variation among males. The same factors are at work for women but are less vividly revealed. The identification of factors is supported by a review of epidemiologic studies and strengthened by correlations with observable behavioral variables. Results are not sensitive to the choice of factor-analytic method used. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of interstate variation in mortality among white working-age adults in the United States is associated with a combination of smoking and obesity, substance abuse and rural/urban residence.},

abstract = {The age-at-death distribution is a representation of the mortality experience in a population. Although it proves to be highly informative, it is often neglected when it comes to the practice of past or future mortality assessment. We propose an innovative method to mortality modeling and forecasting by making use of the location and shape measures of a density function, i.e. statistical moments. Time series methods for extrapolating a limited number of moments are used and then the reconstruction of the future age-at-death distribution is performed. The predictive power of the method seems to be net superior when compared to the results obtained using classical approaches to extrapolating age-specific-death rates, and the accuracy of the point forecast (MASE) is improved on average by 33{\%} respective to the state-of-the-art, the Lee–Carter model. The method is tested using data from the Human Mortality Database and implemented in a publicly available R package.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Motivated by a recent discovery that the two-step inference for the Lee–Carter mortality model may be inconsistent when the mortality index does not follow from a nearly integrated AR(1) process, we propose a test for a unit root in a Lee–Carter model with an AR(p) process for the mortality index. Although testing for a unit root has been studied extensively in econometrics, the method and asymptotic results developed in this paper are unconventional. Unlike a blind application of existing R packages for implementing the two-step inference procedure in Lee and Carter (1992) to the U.S. mortality rate data, the proposed test rejects the null hypothesis that the mortality index follows from a unit root AR(1) process, which calls for serious attention on using the future mortality projections based on the Lee–Carter model in policy making, pricing annuities and hedging longevity risk. A simulation study is conducted to examine the finite sample behavior of the proposed test too.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, urban populations in Europe and North America continued to be afflicted by very high mortality as rapid urbanization and industrialization processes got underway. Here we measure the effect of population redistribution from (low-mortality) rural to (high-mortality) urban areas on changes in Scottish life expectancy at birth from 1861 to 1910. Using vital registration data for that period, we apply a new decomposition method that decomposes changes in life expectancy into the contributions of two main components: (1) changes in mortality; and (2) compositional changes in the population. We find that, besides an urban penalty (higher mortality in urban areas), an urbanization penalty (negative effect of population redistribution to urban areas on survival) existed in Scotland during the study period. In the absence of the urbanization penalty, Scottish life expectancy at birth could have attained higher values by the beginning of the twentieth century.},

@article{OHagan2017,
abstract = {Clustering is used by actuaries in a data compression process to make
massive or nested stochastic simulations practical to run. A large data
set of assets or liabilities is partitioned into a user-defined number
of clusters, each of which is compressed to a single representative
policy. The representative policies can then simulate the behavior of
the entire portfolio over a large range of stochastic scenarios. Such
processes are becoming increasingly important in understanding product
behavior and assessing reserving requirements in a big-data environment.
This article proposes a variety of clustering techniques that can be
used for this purpose. Initialization methods for performing clustering
compression are also compared, including principal components, factor
analysis, and segmentation. A variety of methods for choosing a
cluster's representative policy is considered. A real data set
comprising variable annuity policies, provided by Milliman, is used to
test the proposed methods. It is found that the compressed data sets
produced by the new methods, namely, model-based clustering, Ward's
minimum variance hierarchical clustering, and k-medoids clustering, can
replicate the behavior of the uncompressed (seriatim) data more
accurately than those obtained by the existing Milliman method. This is
verified within sample by examining location variable totals of the
representative policies versus the uncompressed data at the five levels
of compression of interest. More crucially it is also verified out of
sample by comparing the distributions of the present values of several
variables after 20 years across 1000 simulated scenarios based on the
compressed and seriatim data, using Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit
tests and weighted sums of squared differences.},

@article{Case2017,
abstract = {Building on our earlier research (Case and Deaton 2015), we find that mortality and morbidity among white non-Hispanic Americans in midlife since the turn of the century continued to climb through 2015. Additional increases in drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related liver mortality— particularly among those with a high school degree or less—are responsible for an overall increase in all-cause mortality among whites. We find marked dif-ferences in mortality by race and education, with mortality among white non-Hispanics (males and females) rising for those without a college degree, and falling for those with a college degree. In contrast, mortality rates among blacks and Hispanics have continued to fall, irrespective of educational attainment. Mortality rates in comparably rich countries have continued their premillennial fall at the rates that used to characterize the United States. Contemporaneous levels of resources—particularly slowly growing, stagnant, and even declin-ing incomes—cannot provide a comprehensive explanation for poor mortality outcomes. We propose a preliminary but plausible story in which cumulative disadvantage from one birth cohort to the next—in the labor market, in mar-riage and child outcomes, and in health—is triggered by progressively worsen-ing labor market opportunities at the time of entry for whites with low levels of education. This account, which fits much of the data, has the profoundly nega-tive implication that policies—even ones that successfully improve earnings},

Other theorists seem to disregard the problem altogether. In the present discussion we intend to go to the other extreme, by concentrating entirely on the uncertainty of lifetime and ignoring the other uncertainties which a consumer must normally cope with. The uncertainty of future earnings, for instance, will enter the discussion only insofar as the flow of earnings stops when the consumer dies.},

@article{Caswell2018,
abstract = {Background: Increases in human longevity have made it critical to distinguish healthy longevity from longevity without regard to health. Current methods focus on expectations of healthy longevity, and are often limited to binary health outcomes (e.g., disabled vs. not disabled). We present a new matrix formulation for the statistics of healthy longevity, based on health prevalence data and Markov chain theory, applicable to any kind of health outcome and which provides variances and higher moments as well as expectations of healthy life. Method: The model is based on a Markov chain description of the life course coupled with the moments of health outcomes ("rewards") at each age or stage. As an example, we apply the method to nine European countries using the SHARE survey data on the binary outcome of disability as measured by activities of daily living, and the continuous health outcome of hand grip strength. Results: We provide analytical formulas for the mean, variance, coefficient of variation, skewness and other statistical properties of healthy longevity. The analysis is applicable to binary, categorical, ordinal, or interval scale health outcomes. The results are easily evaluated in any matrix-oriented software. The SHARE results reveal familiar patterns for the expectation of life and of healthy life: women live longer than men but spend less time in a healthy condition. New results on the variance shows that the standard deviation of remaining healthy life declines with age, but the coefficient of variation is nearly constant. Remaining grip strength years decrease with age more dramatically than healthy years but their variability pattern is similar to the pattern of healthy years. Patterns are similar across nine European countries. Conclusions: The method extends, in several directions, current calculations of health expectancy (HE) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). It applies to both categorical and continuous health outcomes, to combinations of multiple outcomes (e.g., death and disability in the formulation of DALYs) and to age- or stage-classified models. It reveals previously unreported patterns of variation among individuals in the outcomes of healthy longevity.},

Objectives To describe income-related differences in life expectancy and causes of death in Norway and to compare those differences with US estimates. Design and Setting A registry-based study including all Norwegian residents aged at least 40 years from 2005 to 2015. Exposures Household income adjusted for household size. Main Outcomes and Measures Life expectancy at 40 years of age and cause-specific mortality. Results In total, 3 041 828 persons contributed 25 805 277 person-years and 441 768 deaths during the study period (mean [SD] age, 59.3 years [13.6]; mean [SD] number of household members per person, 2.5 [1.3]). Life expectancy was highest for women with income in the top 1{\%} (86.4 years [95{\%} CI, 85.7-87.1]) which was 8.4 years (95{\%} CI, 7.2-9.6) longer than women with income in the lowest 1{\%}. Men with the lowest 1{\%} income had the lowest life expectancy (70.6 years [95{\%} CI, 69.6-71.6]), which was 13.8 years (95{\%} CI, 12.3-15.2) less than men with the top 1{\%} income. From 2005 to 2015, the differences in life expectancy by income increased, largely attributable to deaths from cardiovascular disease, cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dementia in older age groups and substance use deaths and suicides in younger age groups. Over the same period, life expectancy for women in the highest income quartile increased 3.2 years (95{\%} CI, 2.7-3.7), while life expectancy for women in the lowest income quartile decreased 0.4 years (95{\%} CI, −1.0 to 0.2). For men, life expectancy increased 3.1 years (95{\%} CI, 2.5-3.7) in the highest income quartile and 0.9 years (95{\%} CI, 0.2-1.6) in the lowest income quartile. Differences in life expectancy by income levels in Norway were similar to differences observed in the United States, except that life expectancy was higher in Norway in the lower to middle part of the income distribution in both men and women. Conclusions and Relevance In Norway, there were substantial and increasing gaps in life expectancy by income level from 2005 to 2015. The largest differences in life expectancy between Norway and United States were for individuals in the lower to middle part of the income distribution.},

abstract = {In this paper we review the available summary measures for the magnitude of socio-economic inequalities in health. Measures which have been used differ in a number of important respects, including (1) the measurement of 'relative' or 'absolute' differences; (2) the measurement of an 'effect' of lower socio-economic status, or of the 'total impact' of socio-economic inequalities in health upon the health status of the population; (3) simple versus sophisticated measurement techniques. Based on this analysis of summary measures which have previously been applied, eight different classes of summary measures can be distinguished. Because measures of 'total impact' can be further subdivided on the basis of their underlying assumptions, we finally arrive at 12 types of summary measure. Each of these has its merits, and choice of a particular type of summary measure will depend partly on technical considerations, partly on one's perspective on socio-economic inequalities in health. In practice, it will often be useful to compare the results of several summary measures. These principles are illustrated with two examples: one on trends in the magnitude of inequalities in mortality by occupational class in Finland, and one on trends in the magnitude of inequalities in self-reported morbidity by level of education in the Netherlands.},

abstract = {Several independent analyses, by both epidemiologists and actuaries, have concluded that the previous rate of improvement of life expectancy in England and Wales has now slowed markedly, and at older ages may even be reversing. However, although these findings have led the pension industry to reduce estimates of future liabilities, they have failed to elicit any significant concern in the Department of Health and Social Care. In this essay, we review the evidence on changing life expectancy, noting that the problems are greatest among older women. We then estimate the gap between what life expectancy is now and what it might have been had previous trends continued. At age 85, the gap is 0.34 years for women and 0.23 for men. We argue that recent changes cannot be dismissed as a temporary aberration. While the causes of this phenomenon are contested, there is growing evidence to point to the austerity policies implemented in recent years as at least a partial explanation. We conclude by calling for a fully independent enquiry to ascertain what is happening to life expectancy in England and Wales and what should be done about it.},

Life disparity is a measure of how much lifespans differ among individuals. We define a death as premature if postponing it to a later age would decrease life disparity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In 89 of the 170 years from 1840 to 2009, the country with the highest male life expectancy also had the lowest male life disparity. This was true in 86 years for female life expectancy and disparity. In all years, the top several life expectancy leaders were also the top life disparity leaders. Although only 38{\%} of deaths were premature, fully 84{\%} of the increase in life expectancy resulted from averting premature deaths. The reduction in life disparity resulted from reductions in early-life disparity, that is, disparity caused by premature deaths; late-life disparity levels remained roughly constant.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The countries that have been the most successful in averting premature deaths have consistently been the life expectancy leaders. Greater longevity and greater equality of individuals' lifespans are not incompatible goals. Countries can achieve both by reducing premature deaths.},

We derive the fitting procedures of the M7-M5 and common age effect+Cohorts models and define the level of longevity risk reduction. Based on a wide range of hedging scenarios of pension plans, we find that the risk reduction levels are often around 50{\%}–80{\%} for a large plan, while the risk reduction estimates are usually smaller than 50{\%} for a small plan. Moreover, index-based hedging looks more effective under a more precise hedging scheme. We also perform a detailed sensitivity analysis on the hedging results. The most important modelling features are the behaviour of simulated future variability, portfolio size, speed of reaching coherence, data size and characteristics, simulation method, and mortality structural changes.},

@article{Bergmeir2012,
abstract = {In time series predictor evaluation, we observe that with respect to the model selection procedure there is a gap between evaluation of traditional forecasting procedures, on the one hand, and evaluation of machine learning techniques on the other hand. In traditional forecasting, it is common practice to reserve a part from the end of each time series for testing, and to use the rest of the series for training. Thus it is not made full use of the data, but theoretical problems with respect to temporal evolutionary effects and dependencies within the data as well as practical problems regarding missing values are eliminated. On the other hand, when evaluating machine learning and other regression methods used for time series forecasting, often cross-validation is used for evaluation, paying little attention to the fact that those theoretical problems invalidate the fundamental assumptions of cross-validation. To close this gap and examine the consequences of different model selection procedures in practice, we have developed a rigorous and extensive empirical study. Six different model selection procedures, based on (i) cross-validation and (ii) evaluation using the series' last part, are used to assess the performance of four machine learning and other regression techniques on synthetic and real-world time series. No practical consequences of the theoretical flaws were found during our study, but the use of cross-validation techniques led to a more robust model selection. To make use of the "best of both worlds", we suggest that the use of a blocked form of cross-validation for time series evaluation became the standard procedure, thus using all available information and circumventing the theoretical problems. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We specifically examined the shape of the associations between income and mortality with focus on where in the income distribution that higher incomes began to provide diminishing returns. The study is based on a total Swedish population cohort between the ages of 50 and 60 years in 1990 (n=801,017) followed in registers for up to 19 years. We measured equivalent disposable household income in 1990 and 2005 and mortality between 2006 and 2009. Cox proportional hazard models with penalized splines (P-spline) enabled us to examine for non-linearity in the relationship between income and mortality. The results showed a clear non-linear association. The shape of the association between midlife (ages 50–60) income and mortality was curvilinear; returns diminished as income increased. The shape of the association between late-life (ages 65–75) income and mortality was also curvilinear; returns diminished as income increased. The association between late-life income and mortality remained after controlling for midlife income. In summary, the results indicated that a non-linear association between income and mortality is maintained into old age, in which higher incomes give diminishing returns.},

abstract = {This paper explores and develops alternative statistical representations and estimation approaches for dynamic mortality models. The framework we adopt is to reinterpret popular mortality models such as the Lee-Carter class of models in a general state-space modelling methodology, which allows modelling, estimation and forecasting of mortality under a unified framework. Furthermore, we propose an alternative class of model identification constraints which is more suited to statistical inference in filtering and parameter estimation settings based on maximization of the marginalized likelihood or in Bayesian inference. We then develop a novel class of Bayesian state-space models which incorporate apriori beliefs about the mortality model characteristics as well as for more flexible and appropriate assumptions relating to heteroscedasticity that present in observed mortality data. We show that multiple period and cohort effect can be cast under a state-space structure. To study long term mortality dynamics, we introduce stochastic volatility to the period effect. The estimation of the resulting stochastic volatility model of mortality is performed using a recent class of Monte Carlo procedure specifically designed for state and parameter estimation in Bayesian state-space models, known as the class of particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We illustrate the framework we have developed using Danish male mortality data, and show that incorporating heteroscedasticity and stochastic volatility markedly improves model fit despite an increase of model complexity. Forecasting properties of the enhanced models are examined with long term and short term calibration periods on the reconstruction of life tables.},

The model adopts a convergence structure from “initial” to “long-term” rates of mortality improvement as the process of projection. The initial rates of mortality improvement are derived using two-dimensional P-spline methodology. Given the short history of Chinese data, the long-term rates of mortality improvement are determined by borrowing information from international experience. K-means clustering with dynamic time warping distance is used to classify populations, which is novel in the actuarial mortality research field. The original CMI approach is deterministic, however, in this paper we make it stochastic using techniques outlined by Koller and described by Browne {\textless}italic{\textgreater}et al{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} .

abstract = {Model averaging combines forecasts obtained from a range of models, and it often produces more accurate forecasts than a forecast from a single model. The crucial part of forecast accuracy improvement in using the model averaging lies in the determination of optimal weights from a finite sample. If the weights are selected sub-optimally, this can affect the accuracy of the model-averaged forecasts. Instead of choosing the optimal weights, we consider trimming a set of models before equally averaging forecasts from the selected superior models. Motivated by Hansen, Lunde and Nason (2011), we apply and evaluate the model confidence set procedure when combining mortality forecasts. The proposed model averaging procedure is motivated by Samuels and Sekkel (2017) based on the concept of model confidence sets as proposed by Hansen et al. (2011) that incorporates the statistical significance of the forecasting performance. As the model confidence level increases, the set of superior models generally decreases. The proposed model averaging procedure is demonstrated via national and sub-national Japanese mortality for retirement ages between 60 and 100+. Illustrated by national and sub-national Japanese mortality for ages between 60 and 100+, the proposed model-average procedure gives the smallest interval forecast errors, especially for males. We find that robust out-of-sample point and interval forecasts may be obtained from the trimming method. By robust, we mean robustness against model misspecification.},

abstract = {Assessing longevity risk is crucial to the financial management of annuities and longevity-related financial instruments. Actuaries have been using socio-economic circumstances (SEC) of individuals estimated through postcodes, pension size, and occupation to price annuities for prospective customers. Differences in mortality rates of people in different SEC have been discussed extensively but less is known about how their mortality rates have changed over time. A lack of regular, consistent, and credible mortality data for people in different SEC has hampered the study of historical mortality trends. This in turn has made forecasting a greater challenge. To address some of these data issues, we have obtained mortality and population data between 1981 and 2007 for England, divided into SEC quintiles (measured by the relative deprivation of the area of residence according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2007). Using the data, we have analysed the mortality trends by SEC. These findings can provide insight into mortality improvement for people in different SEC. This can contribute to commercial decisions for annuity businesses, reinsurance and longevity swaps.},

@article{Hilton2018,
abstract = {Forecasts of mortality provide vital information about future populations, with implications for pension and health-care policy as well as for decisions made by private companies about life insurance and annuity pricing. Stochastic mortality forecasts allow the uncertainty in mortality predictions to be taken into consideration when making policy decisions and setting product prices. Longer lifespans imply that forecasts of mortality at ages 90 and above will become more important in such calculations. This paper presents a Bayesian approach to the forecasting of mortality that jointly estimates a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) for mortality for the majority of the age-range and a parametric model for older ages where the data are sparser. The GAM allows smooth components to be estimated for age, cohort and age-specific improvement rates, together with a non-smoothed period effect. Forecasts for the United Kingdom are produced using data from the Human Mortality Database spanning the period 1961-2013. A metric that approximates predictive accuracy under Leave-One-Out cross-validation is used to estimate weights for the `stacking' of forecasts with different points of transition between the GAM and parametric elements. Mortality for males and females are estimated separately at first, but a joint model allows the asymptotic limit of mortality at old ages to be shared between sexes, and furthermore provides for forecasts accounting for correlations in period innovations. The joint and single sex model forecasts estimated using data from 1961-2003 are compared against observed data from 2004-2013 to facilitate model assessment.},

abstract = {Longevity risk faced by annuity portfolios and defined-benefit pension schemes is typically long-term, i.e. the risk is of an adverse trend which unfolds over a long period of time. However, there are circumstances when it is useful to know by how much expectations of future mortality rates might change over a single year. Such an approach lies at the heart of the one-year, value-at-risk view of reserves, and also for the pending Solvency II regime for insurers in the European Union. This paper describes a framework for determining how much a longevity liability might change based on new information over the course of one year. It is a general framework and can accommodate a wide choice of stochastic projection models, thus allowing the user to explore the importance of model risk. A further benefit of the framework is that it also provides a robustness test for projection models, which is useful in selecting an internal model for management purposes.},

The insurance industry is concerned with many problems of interest to the operational research community. This paper presents a case study involving two such problems and solves them using a variety of techniques within the methodology of data mining. The first of these problems is the understanding of customer retention patterns by classifying policy holders as likely to renew or terminate their policies. The second is better understanding claim patterns, and identifying types of policy holders who are more at risk. Each of these problems impacts on the decisions relating to premium pricing, which directly affects profitability. A data mining methodology is used which views the knowledge discovery process within an holistic framework utilising hypothesis testing, statistics, clustering, decision trees, and neural networks at various stages. The impacts of the case study on the insurance company are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a major public health burden, causing 80,000 deaths annually in England and Wales, with major inequalities. However, there are no recent analyses of age-specific socioeconomic trends in mortality. We analysed annual trends in inequalities in age-specific CHD mortality rates in small areas in England, grouped into deprivation quintiles.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We calculated CHD mortality rates for 10-year age groups (from 35 to ≥ 85 years) using three year moving averages between 1982 and 2006. We used Joinpoint regression to identify significant turning points in age- sex- and deprivation-specific time trends. We also analysed trends in absolute and relative inequalities in age-standardised rates between the least and most deprived areas.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Between 1982 and 2006, CHD mortality fell by 62.2{\%} in men and 59.7{\%} in women. Falls were largest for the most deprived areas with the highest initial level of CHD mortality. However, a social gradient in the pace of fall was apparent, being steepest in the least deprived quintile. Thus, while absolute inequalities narrowed over the period, relative inequalities increased. From 2000, declines in mortality rates slowed or levelled off in the youngest groups, notably in women aged 45-54 in the least deprived groups. In contrast, from age 55 years and older, rates of fall in CHD mortality accelerated in the 2000s, likewise falling fastest in the least deprived quintile.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Age-standardised CHD mortality rates have declined substantially in England, with the steepest falls in the most affluent quintiles. However, this concealed contrasting patterns in underlying age-specific rates. From 2000, mortality rates levelled off in the youngest groups but accelerated in middle aged and older groups. Mortality analyses by small areas could provide potentially valuable insights into possible drivers of inequalities, and thus inform future strategies to reduce CHD mortality across all social groups.},

The GMWB gives the policyholder the right to make periodical withdrawals from her policy account even when the value of this account is exhausted. Typically, the total amount guaranteed for withdrawals coincides with her initial investment, providing then a protection against downside market risk. At each withdrawal date, the policyholder has to decide whether, and how much, to withdraw, or to surrender the contract. We show how different policyholder's withdrawal behaviours can be modelled. We perform a sensitivity analysis comparing the numerical results obtained for different contractual and market parameters, policyholder behaviours and different types of Levy processes.},

abstract = {Income inequality in the USA has increased over the past four decades. Socioeconomic gaps in survival have also increased. Life expectancy has risen among middle-income and high-income Americans whereas it has stagnated among poor Americans and even declined in some demographic groups. Although the increase in income inequality since 1980 has been driven largely by soaring top incomes, the widening of survival inequalities has occurred lower in the distribution—ie, between the poor and upper-middle class. Growing survival gaps across income percentiles since 2001 reflect falling real incomes among poor Americans as well as an increasingly strong association between low income and poor health. Changes in individual risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and substance abuse play a part but do not fully explain the steeper gradient. Distal factors correlated with rising inequality including unequal access to technological innovations, increased geographical segregation by income, reduced economic mobility, mass incarceration, and increased exposure to the costs of medical care might have reduced access to salutary determinants of health among low-income Americans. Having missed out on decades of income growth and longevity gains, low-income Americans are increasingly left behind. Without interventions to decouple income and health, or to reduce inequalities in income, we might see the emergence of a 21st century health-poverty trap and the further widening and hardening of socioeconomic inequalities in health.},

abstract = {This and the follow-up paper deal with the valuation and hedging of bilateral counterparty risk on over-the-counter derivatives. Our study is done in a multiple-curve setup reflecting the various funding constraints (or costs) involved, allowing one to investigate the question of interaction between bilateral counterparty risk and funding. The first task is to define a suitable notion of no arbitrage price in the presence of various funding costs. This is the object of this paper, where we develop an “additive, multiple curve” extension of the classical “multiplicative (discounted), one curve” risk-neutral pricing approach. We derive the dynamic hedging interpretation of such an “additive risk-neutral” price, starting by consistency with pricing by replication in the case of a complete market. This is illustrated by a completely solved example building over previous work by Burgard and Kjaer.},
